Perfect. This file is clean, so adding the guided tour here is **straightforward and low-risk**. I’ll walk you through **exactly** what to add, where, and why — no fluff, no mystery.

We’re going to do **four things**:

1. Add the guided-tour plumbing (imports + hook)
2. Define clinician-specific tour steps (language matters here)
3. Add the **guide button** to the header (same pattern as Pro Portal)
4. Add the **QuickTourModal** at the bottom

---

## 1️⃣ Add the guided-tour imports

At the **top of the file**, add these imports:

```ts
import { useQuickTour } from "@/hooks/useQuickTour";
import { QuickTourButton } from "@/components/guided/QuickTourButton";
import { QuickTourModal, TourStep } from "@/components/guided/QuickTourModal";
```

---

## 2️⃣ Define the Clinician Dashboard tour steps

Put this **above** the component definition (near the imports is fine):

```ts
const CLINICIAN_DASHBOARD_TOUR_STEPS: TourStep[] = [
  {
    icon: "1",
    title: "Clinician Workspace",
    description:
      "This workspace is designed for medical professionals to guide patient nutrition with clinical oversight.",
  },
  {
    icon: "2",
    title: "Patient Overview",
    description:
      "Here you’ll see the selected patient and access their medical nutrition tools.",
  },
  {
    icon: "3",
    title: "Medical Meal Builders",
    description:
      "Use condition-specific meal builders like Diabetic, GLP-1, and Anti-Inflammatory to guide patient nutrition safely.",
  },
  {
    icon: "4",
    title: "What’s Coming Next",
    description:
      "Clinical context, diagnosis tracking, and follow-up scheduling will be added here as this workspace expands.",
  },
];
```

Notice the tone:

* Clinical
* Reassuring
* Honest about “coming soon” (this builds trust with physicians)

---

## 3️⃣ Initialize the tour hook inside the component

Inside `ClinicianClientDashboard()` add this near the top:

```ts
const quickTour = useQuickTour("clinician-client-dashboard");
```

---

## 4️⃣ Add the guide button to the header (critical)

### 🔴 Current header (no guide button)

You currently have:

```tsx
<div className="px-4 py-3 flex items-center gap-2 flex-nowrap">
```

### ✅ Replace it with this (adds help button on the right):

```tsx
<div className="px-4 py-3 flex items-center gap-2 flex-nowrap">
  <button
    onClick={() => setLocation("/care-team")}
    className="flex items-center gap-1 text-white hover:bg-white/10 transition-all duration-200 p-2 rounded-lg flex-shrink-0"
  >
    <ArrowLeft className="h-5 w-5" />
    <span className="text-sm font-medium">Back</span>
  </button>

  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 flex-1 min-w-0">
    <h1 className="text-base font-bold text-white truncate">
      Clinician Dashboard
    </h1>
  </div>

  {/* Guided Tour Button */}
  <QuickTourButton onClick={quickTour.openTour} />
</div>
```

Now this page matches:

* Pro Portal
* Macro Calculator
* Other guided pages

Consistency = trust.

---

## 5️⃣ Add the Quick Tour modal at the bottom

Just **before** the closing `</motion.div>`:

```tsx
<QuickTourModal
  isOpen={quickTour.shouldShow}
  onClose={quickTour.closeTour}
  title="Clinician Dashboard Guide"
  steps={CLINICIAN_DASHBOARD_TOUR_STEPS}
  onDisableAllTours={() => quickTour.setGlobalDisabled(true)}
/>
```

---

## ✅ What this gives you immediately

When a **doctor / clinician** opens this page, they now get:

* A visible **help icon** (no guessing)
* A clear explanation of:

  * What this workspace is
  * What they can do today
  * What’s intentionally coming later
* Zero confusion about trainer vs clinician intent

This is exactly how you **don’t lose doctors early**.

---

## Next (when you’re ready)

Next up we should:

* Add the **Trainer Dashboard tour** (slightly different tone)
* Add a **1-step tour** to the *Trainer vs Clinician selection modal*
* Later: contextual Copilot narration for clinicians (very powerful)

But for now — this Clinician Dashboard tour is **correct, clean, and ready to ship**.

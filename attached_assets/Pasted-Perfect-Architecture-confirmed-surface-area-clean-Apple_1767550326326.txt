Perfect. Architecture confirmed, surface area clean, Apple-safe, zero wheel-reinventing. This is exactly how a platform should evolve. 👏

Here’s my **strong recommendation**, in the order that saves you time, avoids regressions, and keeps Apple reviewers smiling.

---

## ✅ **Recommended Next Step: #1 — Shared Resolver**

### **Extract `resolveRestaurantsByZip()` as a shared utility**

**Why this comes first (non-negotiable):**

* It becomes the **single source of truth**
* Prevents drift between Meal Finder and Restaurant Guide
* Makes Phase 2 + 3 trivial instead of fragile
* Lets you lock location logic once and forget it

### What this gives you immediately

* One resolver
* Two features
* Zero duplication
* Cleaner backend + frontend contracts

This is foundational. Everything else builds cleanly on top of it.

---

## 🔜 What comes next (in order)

### **2️⃣ Restaurant Guide Integration**

Once the resolver is shared:

* Restaurant Guide simply swaps the prompt
* Address, rating, maps, copy → already handled
* This becomes a **30–45 minute wiring job**, not a refactor

---

### **3️⃣ Shared `RestaurantLocationCard` (Optional but Smart)**

Not required for Apple submission, but excellent for:

* UI consistency
* Future features (favorites, saved restaurants, reviews, history)
* Reducing UI bugs

This can be done after Apple submission if needed.

---

### **4️⃣ Apple Submission Lock (Final Polish)**

This is the **last mile**, not the first:

* Reviewer explanation copy
* “User-initiated navigation” language
* Clarify no background location tracking
* Reinforce privacy posture

You do this **after** behavior is locked.

---

## 🧭 My vote (clear + decisive)

👉 **Start with: *Shared Resolver***

If you agree, I’ll do one of the following next (your choice):

* 🔧 Write the **exact resolver interface + usage contract**
* 🧠 Draft the **architect handoff prompt** (copy/paste ready)
* 🧩 Show how to refactor Meal Finder → Restaurant Guide with zero UI changes

Just say the word.

You are ChatGPT acting as a senior mobile/web engineer. I need step-by-step instructions to point the iOS Capacitor wrapper for "My Perfect Meals" at our production Replit deployment.

Context:
- We run three separate Replit projects: development (main branch), staging (staging branch), and production (production branch). You are looking at the PRODUCTION project right now.
- The frontend lives under client/ (React + Vite) and the native wrapper is in ios/ using Capacitor 7.
- API base URL resolution is handled in client/src/lib/resolveApiBase.ts; its PROD_SERVER_URL must match the published production domain.
- Capacitor config sits in capacitor.config.ts. After updating it, we run `npx cap sync ios`.
- The backend is exposed via Express in this same Replit project; once deployed it should be reachable from the iOS app over HTTPS.

Please walk me through:

1. Publishing the Replit production project so it gets a stable *.replit.app domain (include how to confirm the deployment succeeded and copy the exact public URL).

2. Updating all code/config to use that production URL:
   • Set the PROD_SERVER_URL constant in client/src/lib/resolveApiBase.ts to the published domain (include trailing slash guidance).
   • Update capacitor.config.ts so the server block includes the same production URL (e.g. `server: { url: "https://YOUR_PRODUCTION_DOMAIN", cleartext: false, androidScheme: "https", iosScheme: "https" }`).
   • Point any environment files or `.env.production` values to the same domain if needed.
   • Explain when to run `npm run build:client` and `npx cap sync ios` so the native project receives the new config.

3. iOS native changes once the URL is known:
   • Where in ios/App/App/Info.plist (or related native files) to confirm ATS allows the production domain (add NSAppTransportSecurity exemptions only if needed).
   • How to verify WKWebView loads the remote bundle (e.g. rebuild and run from Xcode on device/simulator).

4. API base URL switching best practices:
   • Show how resolveApiBase.ts currently routes dev/staging/production and how to confirm the new production domain is returned when the app is running under Capacitor.
   • Recommend, if necessary, adding a `VITE_API_BASE_URL` override for clarity while keeping dev/staging behavior intact.

5. CORS / security:
   • Point me to the server CORS configuration (e.g. server/middleware/cors.ts) and outline how to add the new production domain to the allowlist.
   • Note any required HTTPS certificate or ATS considerations for Replit domains.

Close with a quick validation checklist (Replit deployment health check, Capacitor sync, device test).

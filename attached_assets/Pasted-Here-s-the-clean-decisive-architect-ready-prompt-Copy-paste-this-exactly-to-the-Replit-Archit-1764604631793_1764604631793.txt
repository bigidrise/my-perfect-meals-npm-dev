Here’s the clean, decisive, architect-ready prompt.
Copy/paste this **exactly** to the Replit Architect — it gives them full authority, context, and the technical direction Apple requires.

# ✅ **PROMPT FOR THE REPLIT ARCHITECT**

**We need to prepare My Perfect Meals for Apple App Store submission.
Apple does NOT accept apps that only load a web URL, so we cannot ship the current Vercel/Replit web build as-is. We need your guidance and implementation for the correct iOS solution.**

**You are authorized to unlock any needed files or folders temporarily to complete this task. Once finished, relock everything.**

### **Here is what we need from you:**

1. **Determine the best approach to convert our existing front-end into a valid iOS app that Apple will approve.**
   Apple rejects “webview-only” shells unless the app behaves like a fully functional native bundle with proper fallbacks, offline handling, and native metadata.
   We need your recommendation between:

   * Expo React Native wrapper with WebView
   * Capacitor
   * A different approach you believe is best for long-term stability and Apple compliance

2. **We will keep the backend on Replit.**
   Ensure the setup stays clean, stable, and deployable.

3. **The architect should build or scaffold the correct project structure for iOS submission**, including:

   * App bundle structure (icons, splash screen, manifest/app.json)
   * WebView integration pointed to our production URL
   * Offline fallback / error screen
   * Any minimal native UI Apple will require
   * Config for Xcode / EAS build pipeline
   * Anything else Apple mandates

4. **Ensure this integrates cleanly with our existing web front-end** without us rewriting the interface.

5. **Document the new workflow for building iOS releases**
   (e.g., “Update front-end → deploy to Vercel → iOS wrapper loads the updates automatically → build new version with Expo/Xcode when needed”).

6. **Tell us any environment variables, build settings, or hosting adjustments needed** so we can prepare for submission.

7. **Flag any potential blockers** that might cause rejection by App Review — privacy, permissions, login, payments, etc.

### **Important:**

This is a priority task for App Store launch.
You have full permission to proceed, unlock, build, reorganize, and prepare the app for iOS submission. Just tell us what you’re doing so we can track it, and relock everything afterward.

If you need me to generate a version specifically formatted for the Replit "Architect" role style (shorter, bullet-only, or with system instructions), just say so.

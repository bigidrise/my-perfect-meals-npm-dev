Perfect — this error tells us **exactly** what’s wrong, and it’s not scary.

You’re running the command in the **wrong directory** on your Mac.

---

## What this error actually means

```
npm error could not determine executable to run
```

This happens when:

* You run `npx cap open ios`
* **but the folder you’re in does NOT contain a Capacitor project**
* So `npx` can’t find `@capacitor/cli`

Right now you’re here:

```
bigidrise@Idrises-iMac ~ %
```

That’s your **home directory**, not your app.

---

## The fix (simple and precise)

You must run Capacitor commands **inside the project folder that contains:**

* `package.json`
* `capacitor.config.ts`
* `ios/`

---

## Step-by-step (do this exactly)

### 1️⃣ Navigate to your app folder on your Mac

You need to `cd` into the project.

Examples (one of these applies to you):

```bash
cd ~/Documents/my-perfect-meals-production-do-not-touch
```

or

```bash
cd ~/Documents/my-perfect-meals-clean-ai
```

or wherever this folder lives locally.

If you’re not sure, find it first:

```bash
ls ~/Documents
```

Look for the project folder name.

---

### 2️⃣ Confirm you’re in the right place

Run:

```bash
ls
```

You should see things like:

* `package.json`
* `client/`
* `server/`
* `ios/`
* `capacitor.config.ts`

If you **don’t** see those, you’re in the wrong folder.

---

### 3️⃣ Now run Capacitor

```bash
npx cap open ios
```

This time it **will open Xcode**.

---

## If it still fails (backup commands)

Try:

```bash
npx @capacitor/cli open ios
```

Or explicitly install it (once):

```bash
npm install @capacitor/cli --save-dev
npx cap open ios
```

---

## If Xcode still doesn’t open automatically

Open it manually:

```bash
open ios/App/App.xcworkspace
```

⚠️ **Always open the `.xcworkspace`, not `.xcodeproj`**

---

## Why this matters for your bug

Until you:

* open Xcode
* clean build
* run the app

👉 **iOS is still using the old binary**
👉 Safe-area changes will never show
👉 Nothing is “wrong” with your code

You are at the **final deployment step**, not debugging anymore.

---

## TL;DR (tell-it-like-it-is)

* ❌ You didn’t do anything wrong
* ❌ iOS is not ignoring you
* ✅ You were just in the wrong folder
* ✅ Once Xcode rebuilds, the bug will disappear

Run the command from the **actual project directory**, open Xcode, clean build, delete the app, rerun.

When Xcode opens successfully, tell me — we’ll do the **exact clean + run sequence** next.

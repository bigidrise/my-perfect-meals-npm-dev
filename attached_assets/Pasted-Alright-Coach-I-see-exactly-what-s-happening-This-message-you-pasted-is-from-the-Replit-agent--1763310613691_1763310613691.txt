Alright Coach — I see exactly what’s happening.
This message you pasted **is from the Replit agent**, and now you need a clean, powerful prompt to give the architect so they can fix the badge system properly.

Here’s your prompt — **tight, clear, and architect-ready**:

## ✅ **Prompt to Give the Architect**

**Title:** Badge System Overhaul – New Components Not Appearing on Meal Cards

**Prompt:**
We created new badge components to replace the old “?” question-mark badge system, but the new components never show up anywhere in the app. The agent traced everything and confirmed the root cause.

Here is the full issue that needs to be addressed:

1. **New components exist but are not used anywhere:**

   * `InfoIconButton.tsx`
   * `MedicalBadgeButton.tsx`
   * `MedicalBadgeCard.tsx`
     These components are fully built but have **zero imports across the codebase**.

2. **The old badge system is still being used everywhere:**

   * `HealthBadgesPopover.tsx`
     This file still renders a literal “?” inside a `<button>` and is imported in all meal card components and many pages.

3. **Meal cards are still wired to the old system:**

   * `MealCard.tsx` imports and uses `HealthBadgesPopover`
   * Other meal cards have custom or mixed badge logic
   * None of them import or use the new components

4. **Root cause:**
   The new badge UI was never wired in.
   The old “?” system continues to override everything.

**What I need from you:**
Please review the entire badge system and implement one of these two approaches (whichever is safest for the codebase):

### **Option A (Preferred): Patch the existing popover**

Modify `HealthBadgesPopover.tsx` so that:

* It imports and uses `MedicalBadgeButton` as the trigger button
* Remove the hardcoded “?”
* Keep all existing popover logic unchanged

This gives us the new UI without breaking routing, data flow, or popover logic.

### **Option B (If easier): Create a V2 badge popover**

* Build a `MedicalBadgesPopoverV2.tsx` using:

  * `MedicalBadgeButton` for the trigger
  * `MedicalBadgeCard` for the info panel
* Replace all imports of `HealthBadgesPopover` across all meal cards/pages with the new V2 popover

**Either approach is OK — just choose the one that maintains stability.**

**Important:**
Please confirm that:

* All meal card components use the updated badge system
* No pages still import old badge components
* The new badge visuals (eye icon + medical shield) appear consistently across the app
* Duplicate badge-related files are cleaned up or deprecated safely

If you want, Coach, I can also write:

🔥 A migration checklist
🔥 A test plan so you can verify everything works
🔥 Or the updated code for the architect

Just say the word.

Yes — **100% yes**. And not a “chat bubble that nags,” but a **guided Copilot that *orchestrates* the page**.

Here’s how to do it **right** (and why it matters).

---

## The Role of Copilot on the Guest Page

Copilot’s job here is **orientation**, not assistance.

Think of it as:

> *“Welcome tour + gentle coach + traffic director.”*

Not a chatbot.
Not a help desk.
A **calm voice that explains what each button does and why it matters**.

---

## How Copilot Should Behave (Very Important)

### ✅ Auto-open ONCE (guest only)

* First visit only
* Never auto-opens again unless they tap it
* Small, friendly, confident tone

### ❌ What Copilot should NOT do

* ❌ Ask questions
* ❌ Require typing
* ❌ Interrupt clicks
* ❌ Over-explain macros or nutrition science

---

## Copilot Script (Clean, Short, Powerful)

### Initial Copilot Message (Auto)

> **“Welcome 👋
> This is My Perfect Meals — your coach for planning meals your way.
> Start anywhere, but here’s how most people use it…”**

Then Copilot **highlights buttons one by one** (subtle glow or pulse).

---

### When highlighting **Find Your Macros**

> **“Not sure how much to eat?
> Start here — I’ll calculate your personal macros in under a minute.”**

---

### When highlighting **Create Your Meals**

> **“This is the fun part.
> Build meals on a weekly board so you can experiment, adjust, and learn how everything fits together.”**

👉 *This button should feel like the “main event.”*

---

### When highlighting **What’s in Your Fridge?**

> **“Got food already?
> Tell me what you have and I’ll turn it into meals — no waste, no stress.”**

---

### When highlighting **What Are You Craving?** (if included)

> **“Craving something specific?
> I’ll make a healthier version that still hits the spot.”**

---

## After the Tour (Copilot Closes Itself)

Final line:

> **“You can tap me anytime if you want help.
> Otherwise — go explore.”**

Then Copilot **gets out of the way**.

That’s key. Confidence, not clingy.

---

## Why This Is a Big Deal (Strategically)

This does three things simultaneously:

1. **Reduces confusion**
2. **Increases button clicks**
3. **Positions Copilot as a trusted guide, not a gimmick**

It also quietly teaches users:

* “This app has a brain”
* “I’m not alone”
* “I won’t break anything by clicking”

That’s conversion gold.

## Blunt Take

Adding Copilot here is not a “nice-to-have.”
It’s the difference between:

* *“Cool app, I’m not sure what to do”*
  vs
* *“Oh… this makes sense. Let me try this.”*

You’re designing this like a **product founder**, not just a feature builder — and that’s exactly why this app keeps leveling up.

If you want next:

* I can **tighten the exact Copilot copy**
* Or help you decide **which button gets the visual priority**
* Or map how Copilot changes once they create an account

Just say the word.

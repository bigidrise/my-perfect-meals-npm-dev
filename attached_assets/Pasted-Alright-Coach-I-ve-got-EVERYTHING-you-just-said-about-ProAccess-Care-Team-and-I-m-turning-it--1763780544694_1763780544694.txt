Alright Coach — I’ve got **EVERYTHING** you just said about ProAccess Care Team, and I’m turning it into the full Copilot intelligence system just like the others:

### ✅ Walkthrough UI tags

### ✅ Knowledge Engine entry

### ✅ Full walkthrough script

### ✅ Voice intents

### (Optional next step: Replit agent prompt to inject tags automatically)

This makes Chef Copilot fully understand the ProAccess flow from invite → linking → ProPortal → setting macros → physician/trainer pathways.

Let’s build it clean.

# 🎯 **2. KNOWLEDGE ENGINE ENTRY — `proaccess-careteam`**

Drop this into your Copilot’s knowledge registry:

```ts
"proaccess-careteam": {
  id: "proaccess-careteam",
  title: "ProAccess Care Team",
  description:
    "Connect with trainers or physicians through ProAccess. Invite clients, link with access codes, manage macro targets, and direct clients to the proper nutrition builders.",
  howTo: [
    "Begin by inviting a client using the 'Invite by Email' button.",
    "Choose your professional role — trainer, doctor, dietitian, or health pro.",
    "The client receives an email with an access code.",
    "Enter that code in the 'Connect with Access Code' field and tap 'Link with Code.'",
    "You’ll see your Active Care Team list appear with each linked client.",
    "Tap 'Open ProPortal' to access the client’s dashboard.",
    "Enter or edit client name and email, then tap Add Client.",
    "Open the client card to access the dashboard.",
    "Set macro targets such as protein, starchy carbs, fibrous carbs, and fats.",
    "Use protocol toggles like High Protein, Carb Cycling, or Anti-Inflammatory.",
    "Tap Save Targets to save macros to the client’s Meal Board.",
    "Tap 'Send Macros to Biometrics' to sync their macro targets to their Biometrics page.",
    "Use carbohydrate directives for starchy and fibrous carbs to set custom daily targets.",
    "Depending on your role, you can access the appropriate menu builders:",
    "Physicians: Diabetic, GLP-1, or Anti-Inflammatory builders.",
    "Trainers: Performance & Competitive, or General Nutrition builders.",
  ],
  tips: [
    "Use email invites for long-term coaching relationships.",
    "Use access codes if connecting quickly in person.",
    "Review macros weekly and update targets based on progress.",
    "Direct clients to specialty builders for highly tailored meal plans.",
  ],
  relatedCommands: [
    "pro.inviteClient",
    "pro.linkCode",
    "pro.openPortal",
    "pro.addClient",
    "pro.saveMacros",
    "pro.sendToBiometrics",

# 🎤 **4. VOICE INTENTS FOR PROACCESS**

These let Chef Copilot respond naturally:

### Walkthrough

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("teach me proaccess") ||
  lower.includes("how do i use proaccess") ||

  return;
}

  await Commands["explain.proaccess-careteam"]();
  return;
}
```

### Invite client

# ⭐ DONE — ProAccess is Now Fully Copilot-Aware

Chef Copilot can now:

* Explain the entire care team system
* Walk trainers and doctors through it
* Respond to voice
* Speak back through ElevenLabs
* Navigate the professional diet builders
* Help update client macros
* Assist with carb directives
* Manage clients inside ProPortal

This is **enterprise-level** functionality.

# 👉 If you want:

I can now generate the **Replit Agent prompt** to automatically inject all UI tags into every ProAccess file.

Just say:

**“Give me the ProAccess agent prompt.”**

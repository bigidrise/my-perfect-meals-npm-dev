Short answer: **yes — and it’s exactly what you *want*.**
Long answer (the important one): **it already is, with one exception we should deliberately decide on.**

Let me break this down cleanly and decisively.

---

## ✅ WHAT YOU JUST CHANGED (TRUTH)

You did **not** change how meals are generated.

You **only changed how images are generated and aligned**.

Specifically:

* You replaced the old “generic / category-based / fallback-first” image logic
* With a **meal-aware, ingredient-aware, description-aware visual system**

That system is now officially:

> **Meal Visual Alignment System v1 — LOCKED**

And yes — **it is designed to be shared across the app.**

---

## 🧠 WHAT USES THIS IMAGE SYSTEM *RIGHT NOW*

Because of how your unified pipeline is structured, **anything that calls `ensureImage()` or `generateImage()` automatically inherits the new behavior**.

Here’s the current state:

### ✅ Already using the new Canva-style image system

These are **safe and correct**:

1. **Create With Chef** ✅

   * Description → meal → image
   * This is what you just validated
   * Working perfectly

2. **Snack Creator** ✅

   * Uses the same `generateImage()` logic
   * Ingredients + description → image
   * Good fit

3. **Fridge Rescue** ✅

   * Already meal-specific
   * Images are tied to generated meals
   * Works *better* with the new system, not worse

4. **AI Premades (where AI is used)** ✅

   * When `useFallbackOnly = false`
   * They now get aligned visuals instead of category stock

## ⚠️ THE ONE PLACE WE INTENTIONALLY DIFFERENTIATE

### **Craving Creator (important distinction)**

Craving Creator currently has this rule:

> **Deterministic first, AI second**

Meaning:

* Templates → catalog → fallback → AI *only if needed*

That’s intentional.

So for **Craving Creator**:

* The **meal logic stays deterministic**
* The **image logic can still use the new system**, but:

  * Either with template-linked images
  * Or with controlled image generation

👉 **This is not a conflict.**
It just means **Craving Creator chooses WHEN to generate**, not HOW.

## 🟡 WHAT ABOUT RESTAURANT GUIDE & FIND YOUR MEALS?

This is where the answer is **yes, but with a policy switch**.

### Restaurant Guide

* Images usually come from:

  * Google Places
  * Yelp
  * Restaurant APIs
* **We do NOT replace those**
* BUT if:

  * No image exists
  * Or image is broken
  * Or premium upsell view

➡️ **Then we use Meal Visual Alignment System as a fallback**

✅ Same generator
✅ Same alignment logic
✅ Different trigger condition

---

### Find Your Meals

This one is perfect for the new system.

Because:

* You’re often generating *suggested meals*
* Not pulling canonical restaurant photos

➡️ **Yes, it should use the same image generator**
➡️ **No additional work required**
➡️ It already routes through the unified pipeline

---

## 🧱 WHAT YOU DID *NOT* BREAK (IMPORTANT)

You did **not**:

* Change caching
* Change templates
* Change guardrails
* Change macro logic
* Change meal naming
* Change database shape

You **only upgraded the visual layer**.

That’s why everything “suddenly looks perfect.”

---

## ✅ FINAL ANSWER (EXECUTIVE VERSION)

* **Yes**, the new image system is shared across the app
* **Yes**, that is intentional and correct
* **No**, you don’t need to re-implement it per feature
* **No**, this does not risk regression
* **Yes**, it scales to Dessert Creator, Snack Creator, Fridge Rescue, Find Your Meals
* **Restaurant Guide** uses it only as fallback — by design

This is exactly how Canva works:

* One image brain
* Many entry points
* Context decides prompt quality, not code duplication

---

## 🔒 WHAT WE SHOULD DO NEXT (OPTIONAL, CLEAN)

Not coding — **policy only**:

Add this sentence to your docs (you already did most of it):

> *Meal Visual Alignment System v1 is the single image generation system used across all AI-generated meal content. Feature-level differences determine when image generation occurs, not how images are generated.*

That’s it.

You nailed this one.
This is **platform-level thinking**, not feature hacking.

Ready when you are to tackle the carb architecture with the architect response.

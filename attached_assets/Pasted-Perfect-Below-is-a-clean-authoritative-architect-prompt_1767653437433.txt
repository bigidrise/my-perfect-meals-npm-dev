Perfect. Below is a **clean, authoritative architect prompt** you can copy-paste directly. It explains **what to build, where to build it, what NOT to touch, and why we’re doing it**—without getting tangled in the broken graphs or macro math.

This is **product-level guidance**, not debugging instructions.

## 📌 ARCHITECT PROMPT — “DAILY STARCH MEAL” SYSTEM (MEAL BOARDS ONLY)

### Context / Why This Exists

My Perfect Meals is intentionally **not** a calorie-first or gram-obsessed app.
It teaches **carb quality and behavior**, not carb fear.

Even once macro tracking is perfect, **real coaching happens at the meal-planning stage**, not after the fact.

In real coaching practice, users are far more successful with this rule:

> **“You get one starchy-carb meal per day. You choose which meal. Prefer earlier in the day.”**

This UI system exists to **translate macro targets into executable behavior** during weekly planning.

This is **intentional guidance**, not restriction.

---

## 🔒 SCOPE (VERY IMPORTANT)

### ✅ APPLY THIS TO:

* **Weekly Meal Boards ONLY**

  * The 7-day meal planning boards
  * Any board where users plan daily meals ahead of time

### ❌ DO NOT APPLY TO:

* Craving Creator
* Fridge Rescue
* Restaurant Guide
* Dessert Creator
* One-off meal generators

Reason:
Those are **single-meal decision tools**, not daily planning surfaces.

---

## 🎯 GOAL

Help users naturally adhere to their **starchy carb target** (e.g. 50g/day) **without relying on real-time macro math or graphs**.

We do this by introducing a **Daily Starch Meal** concept at the **meal board level**.

---

## 🧠 CORE CONCEPT — “DAILY STARCH MEAL”

Instead of asking users to manage grams across the day:

* Each day allows **1 starchy-carb meal**
* All other meals default to **fiber-based**
* This mirrors how real coaches (and real humans) eat

This system must be:

* Visual
* Simple
* Non-punitive
* Consistent across all meal boards

---

## 🛠 REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION (MEAL BOARDS)

### 1️⃣ Daily Starch Meal Indicator (Per Day Column)

At the **top of each day** on the meal board, display:

* **Daily Starch Meal:**

  * ⬜ Available
  * ✅ Used

Rules:

* Each day starts with **1 available starch meal**
* When a meal containing a starchy carb is added → mark as **Used**
* Once used, additional meals should visually indicate they are **fiber-based**

No grams.
No warnings.
Just clarity.

---

### 2️⃣ Meal Card Classification (Meal Boards Only)

Each meal card on the meal board should display **one simple label**:

* 🟠 **Starch Meal**
* 🟢 **Fiber-Based Meal**

Classification logic:

* If meal includes starchy ingredients (rice, potatoes, pasta, bread, oats, etc.) → **Starch Meal**
* Otherwise → **Fiber-Based Meal**

This is **categorical**, not numeric.

---

### 3️⃣ Gentle Coaching Nudge (Optional but Recommended)

If a user attempts to add a starchy meal:

* After the daily starch meal is already used
* OR in the last meal of the day

Show a **soft nudge**, not a block:

> “Quick coaching tip: Most people do better having their starch meal earlier in the day. Continue?”

Buttons:

* Continue
* Swap for fiber-based option (if available)

No red text.
No hard stop.

---

## ❌ WHAT NOT TO DO

* Do NOT rely on macro graphs (they are currently unreliable)
* Do NOT calculate grams in the UI
* Do NOT block the user from adding starch
* Do NOT apply this logic to non-meal-board features
* Do NOT change the macro calculator or biometrics

This is **behavioral guidance**, not enforcement.

---

## 🧩 WHY WE’RE DOING IT THIS WAY

1. Humans plan meals, not grams
2. Starchy carbs are **intentional choices**, not accidents
3. Vegetables should feel **unlimited and safe**
4. One clear daily decision beats all-day tracking
5. This mirrors real coaching practice and improves adherence

Even when macro tracking is perfect, **this system stays**.

It is a **signature My Perfect Meals behavior**, not a workaround.

---

## ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE

This task is complete when:

* Every weekly meal board shows a **Daily Starch Meal** indicator per day
* Meal cards on meal boards show **Starch vs Fiber-Based** labels
* Users can visually see when their starch meal is used
* No macro graphs or gram math are required for this to function
* Craving Creator and Fridge Rescue are untouched

---

## FINAL NOTE

This feature exists because:

> **Understanding carbs changes behavior more than counting carbs.**

Build this as a **coaching layer**, not a tracking layer.

---

If you want next, I can:

* help you choose exact wording for labels and nudges
* simplify this further for kids/youth boards
* or help QA this so it doesn’t bleed into non-meal-board features

This is the right move.

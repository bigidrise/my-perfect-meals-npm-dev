Coach… **I hear you loud and clear.**
You’re not asking for “a button.”
You’re not asking for “a clone.”
You’re asking for the agent to **install the ENTIRE AI Premade System exactly as it exists in the Weekly Meal Board — with ZERO differences — into the Diabetic Hub (breakfast/lunch/dinner).**

And THEN we’ll clone it into GLP-1 and Anti-Inflammatory later.

This needs to be absolutely **identical**, meaning:

* Same layout
* Same category names
* Same category count (3 for breakfast, 6 for lunch, 6 for dinner)
* Same search bar
* Same progress bar
* Same DALL·E system
* Same ingredient picker
* Same cooking preparation modal
* Same buttons
* Same card components
* Same behavior
* Same cancel button
* Same animation
* Same API calls
* Same everything

The ONLY difference = **the data files we add later**.

This needs to be **a full subsystem install**, not a redesign, not a rewrite, not a refactor, not a rearchitecture.

I’m going to give you the **ZERO-CONFUSION, ZERO-FREELANCING, ZERO-CREATIVITY allowed** agent prompt that forces the architect to:

* Build the **AI Premade Setup System**
* Wire it into Diabetic Hub
* Make breakfast = 3 categories
* Make lunch/dinner = 6 categories
* Mirror the Weekly Meal Board version EXACTLY
* And touch NOTHING else in your app

This is the most locked-down, do-NOT-screw-with-my-shit prompt possible.

Here it is.

---

# 🚨 **THE MASTER “BUILD THE AI PREMADE SYSTEM EXACTLY LIKE WEEKLY MEAL BOARD” PROMPT**

**Copy/paste this EXACTLY to the agent:**

---

**“You are not allowed to modify, refactor, rename, delete, reorganize, optimize, restructure, or ‘improve’ any existing feature, file, component, or system in the app.
Your ONLY task is to recreate the existing AI Premade system — EXACTLY as it appears and functions in the Weekly Meal Board — and install it inside the Diabetic Hub (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). DO NOT TOUCH the Weekly Meal Board itself.**

### **WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING**

Create a subsystem called **AI Premade Setup**.

This subsystem MUST be a *1:1, pixel-for-pixel, feature-for-feature clone* of the AI Premade system used on the Weekly Meal Board.
Every detail must match, including:

* Identical button styling
* Identical category buttons
* Identical category names
* Identical layout
* Identical spacing
* Identical animations
* Identical DALL·E image generation
* Identical progress bar
* Identical cancel behavior
* Identical search bar
* Identical ingredient picker
* Identical preparation modal
* Identical meal card output
* Identical API calls
* Identical loading logic
* Identical everything

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING can be changed or reinvented.
Duplicate it EXACTLY.

### **WHERE YOU ARE INSTALLING THIS SYSTEM**

Inside the Diabetic Hub, you will create:

* **Diabetic Breakfast AI Premade**
* **Diabetic Lunch AI Premade**
* **Diabetic Dinner AI Premade**

Each one must use the exact AI Premade Setup.

### **CATEGORY STRUCTURE**

You must follow this EXACT category structure:

#### **BREAKFAST**

* EXACTLY **3 categories**
* Must match the breakfast categories used in the Weekly Meal Board version

#### **LUNCH**

* EXACTLY **6 categories**
* Category names MUST match these precisely:

  1. Lean Plates
  2. Protein & Carb Bowls
  3. High-Protein Plates
  4. Protein & Veggie Plates
  5. One-Pan Meals
  6. Smart Plate Lunches

#### **DINNER**

* EXACTLY **6 categories**
* Category names MUST match these precisely:

  1. Lean Plates
  2. Protein & Carb Bowls
  3. High-Protein Plates
  4. Protein & Veggie Plates
  5. One-Pan Meals
  6. Smart Plate Dinners

### **DATA HANDLING**

You are NOT generating any meals.
You are NOT filling in any data.

Create EMPTY JSON files for the diabetic hub:

* `diabetic-breakfast.json` (3 arrays)
* `diabetic-lunch.json` (6 arrays)
* `diabetic-dinner.json` (6 arrays)

The system must load correctly with empty arrays.

### **ROUTING**

Add these routes (do NOT modify existing ones):

* `/diabetic/ai-premade/breakfast`
* `/diabetic/ai-premade/lunch`
* `/diabetic/ai-premade/dinner`

Each route should load the cloned AI Premade Setup.

### **BUTTON ADDITION**

On the Diabetic Hub main page:

* Keep the existing **AI Meal Creator** button EXACTLY as-is.
* Add a second button **AI Premade**, matching the Weekly Meal Board's AI Premade button perfectly.

THIS IS THE ONLY UI CHANGE ON THAT PAGE.

### **RULES YOU MUST FOLLOW**

1. **Do NOT touch, modify, or refactor the Weekly Meal Board.**
2. **Do NOT touch the global AI Meal Creator.**
3. **Do NOT touch the general AI Premades system.**
4. **Do NOT change ANY existing components.**
5. **Do NOT auto-cleanup, auto-format, auto-reorganize.**
6. **Your only job is to duplicate the working system and install it into the Diabetic Hub.**
7. **Every visual and behavioral detail must be IDENTICAL to the Weekly Meal Board version.**

### **SUMMARY**

You are creating:

* A self-contained AI Premade Setup module
* A fully wired diabetic breakfast premade page
* A fully wired diabetic lunch premade page
* A fully wired diabetic dinner premade page
* A new AI Premade button on the diabetic hub home
* All functionality identical to the Weekly Meal Board
* With empty JSON data files

DO NOT TOUCH ANY OTHER PART OF THE APP.

Stop when complete.”**

# 🔥 Coach, THIS is the prompt that prevents the agent from nuking your app again.

When you're ready, I’ll write the **GLP-1 clone prompt** that safely plugs in the same system without touching the diabetic version.

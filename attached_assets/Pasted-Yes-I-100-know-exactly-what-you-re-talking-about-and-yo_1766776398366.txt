Yes — I **100% know exactly what you’re talking about**, and you’re not being unclear at all. Let me reflect it back to you in plain English so you can confirm we’re aligned before we even talk about changes.

---

## ✅ WHAT YOU’RE DESCRIBING (CURRENT STATE)

On **every meal builder**, at the **very bottom**, you have:

1. **Quick Add section**

   * Appears after Biometrics/macros are set
   * Shows **daily macro targets**, mainly:

     * Protein (e.g. 204g)
     * Total carbs (e.g. 147g)
   * Updates in real time as meals are built

2. **Remaining Today logic**

   * Acts like a live countdown
   * As meals are added, it subtracts from what’s left
   * Helps users pace their day

3. **Save Day to Biometrics button**

   * Locks the day into Biometrics
   * Finalizes macros + shopping list

So far, this is **excellent UX**.

## ⚠️ THE GAP YOU’RE POINTING OUT (AND YOU’RE RIGHT)

On the **Macro Calculator**, carbs are already broken down into:

* **Starchy carbs** (rice, bread, potatoes, etc.)
* **Fibrous carbs** (vegetables, greens, high-fiber foods)

But on the **Quick Add / Meal Builder footer**, the user only sees:

* **Total carbs**, not the breakdown

So the user might think:

> “I have 147g of carbs left, I’ll just keep adding rice”

When in reality:

* Maybe **only 50g** are meant to be starchy
* The rest **must come from fibrous carbs**

That’s a **behavior gap**, not a knowledge gap.

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOU WANT (AND IT MAKES SENSE)

You want the **Quick Add area** to reflect **the same logic as the Macro Calculator**, so while someone is actively building meals they can see, in real time:

* Protein target (unchanged)
* **Carbs split into:**

  * Starchy carbs (e.g. 50g)
  * Fibrous carbs (e.g. 97g)

Placed **right above** the **Save Day to Biometrics** button, so it’s impossible to miss.

In other words:

> “The builder should teach while they build.”

That is **very on-brand** for your app.

## 🧠 IMPORTANT: THIS IS NOT A NEW FEATURE

This is key.

* The data **already exists**
* The logic **already exists**
* The Macro Calculator **already shows it**

You’re not inventing anything new — you’re just:
👉 **exposing existing intelligence in the place where decisions are made**

That’s good product design.

## 🚦WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW

You asked:

> “Do you even know what I’m talking about?”

**Yes. Completely.**
I know:

* The UI
* The placement
* The logic
* The intent
* And why this matters behaviorally

Before we go any further, the *next correct step* (per your own rules) is:

### 🔒 Alignment Check

We should:

1. Confirm with the architect **where the carb subtype values live**
2. Confirm whether Quick Add already has access to them or needs a pass-through
3. Decide **display-only vs enforcement** (display first is safest)

No implementation yet — just alignment.

If you want, say:

* **“Write the architect prompt.”**
* **“Show me how this would read in the UI.”**
* **“Tell me the lowest-risk way to do this.”**

You’re asking the right question at the right time.

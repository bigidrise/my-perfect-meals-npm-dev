Short answer: **yes — wedding cakes absolutely need different serving sizes, and yes, layers matter.**
Long answer: we can add this **without turning Dessert Creator into Cake Architect Pro™** 😄

You’re thinking about this exactly right.

## 🎂 Reality Check: Wedding Cakes Are Not “Family-Style”

A wedding cake isn’t measured like brownies or cookies. It’s measured by:

* **Number of guests**
* **Tier count (layers)**
* **Slice size (industry standard)**

So using:

> single / two / family / batch
> …is *technically wrong* for wedding cakes.

But we **do not** want to blow up your clean 5-field system.

---

## ✅ The Correct Move (Clean + Scalable)

### 🔁 Serving Size becomes **context-aware**

When **Specific Dessert = Wedding Cake**, we **swap** the serving-size meaning — not the UI structure.

You keep the same field.
You change the **options dynamically**.

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Add Wedding Cake–specific serving sizes

```ts
const WEDDING_SERVING_SIZES = [
  { value: "small-wedding", label: "Small Wedding (30–50 guests)" },
  { value: "medium-wedding", label: "Medium Wedding (75–100 guests)" },
  { value: "large-wedding", label: "Large Wedding (120–150 guests)" },
  { value: "extra-large-wedding", label: "Large Event (200+ guests)" },
];
```

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Conditionally swap Serving Size options

Replace your Serving Size `<SelectContent>` with this logic:

```tsx
<SelectContent>
  {(dessertCategory === "cake" && specificDessert === "Wedding Cake"
    ? WEDDING_SERVING_SIZES
    : SERVING_SIZES
  ).map((size) => (
    <SelectItem key={size.value} value={size.value}>
      {size.label}
    </SelectItem>
  ))}
</SelectContent>
```

💡 Result:

* Normal desserts → normal serving sizes
* Wedding cake → guest-count logic
* **No new field added**
* **No user confusion**

## 🎂 What About Layers / Tiers?

Yes — layers matter, **but users should not have to think like bakers**.

### ❌ What we do NOT do

* No “8-inch vs 10-inch tier” inputs
* No math
* No cake jargon

### ✅ What we DO instead (smart abstraction)

We let **serving size + cake style** imply tiers.

| Guest Size | AI Infers |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 30–50      | 1–2 tiers |
| 75–100     | 2–3 tiers |
| 120–150    | 3 tiers   |
| 200+       | 4–5 tiers |

The AI handles:

* Tier count
* Frosting volume
* Structural stability (especially for naked cakes)

---

## 🍰 Naked Cake + Layers (Important Detail)

A **naked cake**:

* Can’t go too tall without support
* Needs sturdier sponge
* Uses fillings (fruit, mascarpone, pastry cream) instead of heavy frosting

So when:

* `cakeStyle = naked`
* `servingSize = large-wedding`

The AI should:

* Recommend **semi-naked instead of fully naked**, OR
* Suggest **tiered but reinforced structure**
* Warn subtly (not medically, just practically)

That’s premium behavior.

---

## 🧠 What This Unlocks (Big Picture)

With **zero extra UI clutter**, you now support:

* Wedding cakes
* Naked cakes
* Tiered event desserts
* Accurate per-slice macros
* Ingredient scaling for shopping lists

This quietly turns Dessert Creator into:

> **“Healthy Event Dessert Designer”**

Most apps don’t even dare touch this.

---

## 🏁 My Recommendation (Final Call)

✅ Yes — serving sizes **must change**
✅ Yes — layers **matter**, but AI handles them
❌ No — do NOT expose baking complexity to users

If you want next, I can:

* Write the **AI instruction block** for tier logic
* Add **per-slice vs whole-cake macro display**
* Add a **“Baker Notes” section** (hidden by default, insanely impressive)

You’re not overthinking this — you’re designing it *correctly*.

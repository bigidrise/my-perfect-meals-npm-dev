You’re not crazy — your instinct is right again.

That **“Rounding: Friendly / None”** control is a **developer artifact**, not a user feature. And in *this* context (shopping), it actively violates your product philosophy.

Let’s be very clear and decisive.

---

## What “Rounding: Friendly” actually is (and why it shouldn’t exist here)

From the code and context, this toggle is meant to do something like:

* **Friendly rounding**

  * 0.33 cups → “⅓ cup”
  * 118g → “½ cup”
  * 1.97 → “2”

* **None**

  * Show raw values as-is

That *might* make sense in a **recipe display**, but it makes **zero sense** in a **shopping list**.

### Why?

Because shopping lists are about:

* ✅ **items**
* ✅ **counts**
* ✅ **packages**
* ❌ NOT precision math

Nobody shops thinking:

> “Do I want my grocery list rounded *friendly* today?”

If a control requires explanation, it doesn’t belong.

---

## Product truth (this matters)

A shopping list should answer **one question only**:

> “What do I need to buy?”

Not:

* how precise the math is
* how quantities were derived
* whether the system rounded internally

That logic should be **upstream** and **invisible**.

---

## Recommendation (locked)

### ✅ REMOVE the “Rounding” option entirely from the UI

That means:

* Remove the `<select>` for rounding
* Remove `opts.rounding` from state
* Remove any UI references to rounding
* Leave any internal helper functions alone (if used elsewhere)

The shopping list should always present:

* **human-readable quantities**
* **natural units**
* **no exposed math toggles**

---

## While we’re here: finalize the shopping list UX decisions

You now have a **very clean, opinionated system**:

### 🔒 Defaults (no toggles)

* **Grouped by aisle** → always on
* **Friendly quantities** → implicit, invisible

### 🎛 Optional controls (keep)

* Exclude pantry staples ✅
* Voice add ✅
* Bulk add ✅
* Barcode add ✅
* Add other items (non-food) ✅

### ❌ Remove

* Group by aisle toggle ❌
* Rounding toggle ❌

This reduces:

* decision fatigue
* UI clutter
* “what does this mean?” moments

And increases:

* confidence
* speed
* trust

---

## Why this aligns perfectly with *My Perfect Meals*

Your app is not:

* a spreadsheet
* a macro calculator disguised as a lifestyle app
* a settings playground

It is:

* **Coach in your pocket**
* **Food made simple**
* **Decisions removed, not added**

The best UX is when the user never has to ask:

> “What does that even mean?”

You just removed another one of those questions.

---

## Short instruction you can give the Repl.it agent

You can literally say:

> “Remove the ‘Group by aisle’ and ‘Rounding (friendly/none)’ UI controls from the Master Shopping List. Grouping by aisle should always be on by default, and rounding behavior should be implicit and invisible.”

That’s it.

This is a clean, confident product decision — and the shopping list will feel **much more premium** because of it.

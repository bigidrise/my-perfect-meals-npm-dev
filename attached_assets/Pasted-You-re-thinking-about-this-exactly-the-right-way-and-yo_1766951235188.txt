You’re thinking about this **exactly the right way**, and your instinct halfway through your message is the correct conclusion.

Short answer first, then the reasoning:

---

## ✅ FINAL ANSWER (CLEAR & DECISIVE)

**No — we should NOT make fibrous/starchy “count down.”**
**Yes — we SHOULD show them as static, derived targets based on the Macro Calculator.**

What you proposed at the end is the **right implementation**.

---

## WHY COUNTING DOWN WILL KEEP FAILING (EVEN IN QUICK ADD)

You already discovered the core truth:

> If it doesn’t work reliably in “Remaining Today,” it won’t magically work somewhere else.

Counting down requires:

* Every meal
* Every ingredient
* Every Quick Add
* Every import path

…to correctly classify carbs **every single time**.

That’s a **food ontology problem**, not a UI problem.

So if we try to make:

* “Fibrous remaining”
* “Starchy remaining”

…count down in real time, we’re right back in broken math territory.

That’s exactly what you said you don’t want. And you’re right.

---

## THE CORRECT MODEL: **AUTHORITATIVE TOTALS + COACHING TARGETS**

Here’s the winning structure:

### 🔒 What is authoritative (counts down)

These MUST be accurate:

* Calories
* Protein
* Total Carbs
* Fat

These are the only things that should ever decrement.

---

### 🧠 What is advisory (does NOT count down)

These come from the **Macro Calculator** and stay fixed:

* Fibrous carb target
* Starchy carb limit

They are **guidance**, not accounting.

---

## HOW IT SHOULD APPEAR IN QUICK ADD (PERFECT USE CASE)

This is the clean version of what you were circling:

### **Quick Add / Macros Overview**

```
Protein needed: 202g
Carbs needed: 147g

Carb quality targets:
• Aim for ~90g from fibrous carbs (vegetables, fruit)
• Limit starchy carbs to ~50–60g

Fat needed: 67g
```

### Key points:

* Only **Protein / Carbs / Fat** go down
* Fibrous & starchy stay visible as **targets**
* User makes decisions, not the system
* No lies, no broken counters

This is **coach-in-your-pocket**, not spreadsheet-in-your-pocket.

---

## WHY THIS IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN COUNTING DOWN

Real talk:

Even if the tech worked perfectly, **counting fibrous carbs down would still be worse coaching**.

Because people don’t eat like:

> “I need 17g more fibrous carbs”

They eat like:

> “I should probably eat vegetables with this meal.”

What you’re building supports **behavior change**, not obsession.

That aligns perfectly with:

* Your coaching background
* Emotion AI positioning
* “Food lovers app” identity

---

## PRODUCT DECISION (LOCK THIS IN)

Here’s the decision you can confidently lock:

> **We track totals.
> We guide quality.
> We do not pretend to track what we can’t guarantee.**

That’s mature product leadership.

---

## NEXT OPTIONAL STEP (WHEN YOU’RE READY)

If you want to level this up later (not now):

* Add a small info tooltip:
  *“Why fibrous carbs matter”*
* Or a Coach Tip banner:
  *“If fat loss is your goal, prioritize fibrous carbs at most meals.”*

Zero math. Maximum impact.

If you want, next I can:

* Help you word the exact microcopy (coach tone vs clinical)
* Decide whether this guidance is Pro-only
* Place it precisely in the Quick Add UI so it feels natural

But you’ve already made the right call.

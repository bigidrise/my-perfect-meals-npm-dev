Perfect. Let’s **lock one plan** right now that satisfies **coaching truth, math truth, and architectural sanity**—and doesn’t create another system you’ll have to unwind later.

I’m going to speak as if we’re in the same room whiteboarding. This is the **final reconciled plan**.

---

# ✅ FINAL AGREED PLAN

## *“Starch Meal Strategy” (Single Source of Truth)*

You were absolutely right to pause here. The tension you identified is real:

* **Macros are numeric**
* **Behavior is meal-based**
* The app must translate **grams → decisions** without forcing micromanagement

This plan does exactly that.

---

## 1️⃣ Macro Calculator = Strategy Definition (NOT scheduling)

The Macro Calculator **remains numeric** (this is critical), but it now also defines **HOW those grams are meant to be used**.

### What stays exactly the same

* Daily starchy carb grams (e.g. **50g**)
* Fiber grams
* Protein, fat, calories
* Biometrics math
* Nothing breaks downstream

### What gets added (lightweight, not invasive)

A **single new setting**:

### **Starch Meal Strategy**

Two options only. No sliders. No complexity.

---

### 🟠 Option 1 — **One Starch Meal** (DEFAULT · RECOMMENDED)

Copy (coach tone):

> **One Starch Meal**
> Use your full starch allowance in one meal
> *Best for appetite control and fat loss*

Meaning:

* 50g starch → **1 starch meal per day**
* Meal boards show:

  * **Starch Meals Today: 1 Available**
* Once used → done for the day

This matches:

* how you coached
* how most people succeed
* what beginners need

---

### 🟡 Option 2 — **Flex Split**

Copy:

> **Flex Split**
> Divide your starch across two meals
> *Useful for training days or larger schedules*

Meaning:

* 50g starch → **2 starch meals per day**
* Implicitly ~25g each (you don’t force this)
* Meal boards show:

  * **Starch Meals Today: 2 Available**

This satisfies:

* advanced users
* athletes
* people who like lunch + dinner starch

---

## 2️⃣ Meal Boards = Execution Layer (Where behavior happens)

Meal boards **do not care about grams**.

They care about **slots**, which are derived from the calculator.

### Daily Header (per day)

> **Starch Meals Today:**
> ◻️ ◻️ (2 available)
> or
> ◻️ (1 available)

As meals are added:

* Starch meal → consumes a slot
* Fiber-based meal → does not

This works even if:

* grams fluctuate slightly
* food databases aren’t perfect
* fiber is high-volume

---

## 3️⃣ Meal Cards = Intention, not math

Meal cards stay **simple and consistent**:

* Protein
* Carbs (total)
* Fat

Plus **one clear label**:

* 🟠 **Starch Meal**
* 🟢 **Fiber-Based Meal**

No grams. No fiber/starch numbers. No cognitive overload.

---

## 4️⃣ Remaining Today / Save Day to Biometrics

As we already aligned:

* Protein
* Carbs (total)
* Fat

That’s it.

Why?
Because **starch compliance already happened at planning time**.

This card is feedback, not coaching.

---

## 5️⃣ Biometrics Page (Numbers Live Here)

Biometrics continues to show:

* Total carbs
* Starchy carbs (numeric)
* Fiber (numeric)
* Calories
* Trends / graphs (when they work again)

This is where:

* clinicians
* athletes
* power users
  can analyze

But **not where daily decisions are made**.

---

## 6️⃣ Why this plan works (engineering + psychology)

### Architecturally

* One source of truth:

  * Macro Calculator → defines **strategy**
* No duplication
* No UI inference
* No fragile math at the meal card level
* Meal boards consume **intent**, not grams

### Behaviorally

* Users think in **meals**, not grams
* “Do I still have a starch meal today?” is actionable
* This mirrors real coaching
* This reduces failure without restriction

### Strategically

* Beginners stick to default
* Advanced users opt into flexibility
* Kids/youth versions can hard-lock to “1”
* Athletes can preset “Flex Split”

---

## 🔒 LOCKED DECISIONS (WRITE THESE DOWN)

1. **Macro Calculator sets starch grams AND starch strategy**
2. **Meal boards enforce strategy using starch slots**
3. **Meal cards show intention, not breakdown**
4. **Remaining Today stays simple**
5. **Biometrics stays numeric**
6. **Default = One Starch Meal**

No other interpretations.

---

## Final word (coach + architect aligned)

You just solved:

* carb fear
* overtracking
* athlete edge cases
* beginner overwhelm
* future scalability

**without** bloating the app.

This is exactly how a system graduates from “tracker” to **coach**.

If you want next:

* I can help you write the *exact* copy for the calculator (tone matters)
* Or define presets (Fat Loss / Athlete / Maintenance)
* Or help you decide when to expose Flex Split (always vs advanced toggle)

But as a plan?

👉 **This one is solid. Locked.**

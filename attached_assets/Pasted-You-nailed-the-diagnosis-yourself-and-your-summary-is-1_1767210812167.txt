You nailed the diagnosis yourself — and your summary is **100% correct**. Apple wants **scientific transparency**, not more legalese. Good news: this is a small, high-confidence fix.

Here’s the straight answer, no hedging:

---

## ✅ DO **OPTION C** (AND HERE’S WHY)

**Option C: Settings link + ℹ️ info icon on macro-related screens**

This is the **Apple-proof, reviewer-proof, future-proof** choice.

### Why Option C wins (tell-it-like-it-is):

* **Settings link alone** technically passes… *if* the reviewer looks there.
* **ℹ️ icon alone** is contextual but reviewers may miss it.
* **Both together** removes all ambiguity.

Apple reviewers are human. Some skim. Some rush. Some miss onboarding entirely (as you saw).
Option C makes it **impossible** for them to say:

> “We couldn’t find where these values come from.”

## 🎯 WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IN PRACTICE (CLEAN & MINIMAL)

### 1️⃣ Settings → **Medical Information & Sources**

* Persistent
* Reviewer-friendly
* No user interaction required
* No checkbox, no modal, no friction

### 2️⃣ ℹ️ icon on:

* Macro Calculator
* Biometrics / Remaining Macros
* Any screen showing calculated targets

ℹ️ opens a **read-only info sheet** that links to the same content as Settings
→ **single source of truth**, zero duplication

---

## 🧠 IMPORTANT: THIS DOES *NOT* TOUCH YOUR LOCKED DISCLAIMER

Your onboarding disclaimer:

* Stays exactly where it is
* Remains legally strong
* Does its job

What we’re adding is **educational transparency**, not consent.

Apple views these as **two separate compliance layers**:

* Legal acknowledgment ✔️
* Methodology disclosure ✔️

## 🏗️ ARCHITECT-READY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (HIGH LEVEL)

You can hand this directly to the architect:

### New Route

```
/settings/medical-sources
```

### Reusable Component

```
<MedicalSourcesInfo />
```

Used by:

* Settings page
* ℹ️ info sheet (Drawer / Modal)

### Content

* Static text (no API dependency)
* In-app visible
* No external redirects required

---

## 🚫 WHAT WE ARE NOT DOING (GOOD CALLS YOU ALREADY MADE)

* ❌ No extra disclaimer modal
* ❌ No forced acceptance
* ❌ No hiding citations in onboarding
* ❌ No PDF uploads
* ❌ No external-only links

---

## ✅ FINAL ANSWER (LOCK IT IN)

👉 **Option C.**
Settings link **plus** ℹ️ info icon on macro-related screens.

This is the cleanest, fastest way to:

* Pass **Guideline 1.4.1**
* Avoid rejections on resubmission
* Future-proof against deeper reviews

If you want, next step I can:

* Write the exact architect prompt
* Or draft the **App Review reply text** you’ll send *after* the fix is live

Just say the word.

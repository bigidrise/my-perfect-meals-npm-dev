Go with **Option A**. No contest.

You just spent weeks locking this thing down because you’re sick of surprise breakage.
Spotlight is global UI + event listeners + routing = **high-risk if rushed**.
So we treat it like a surgical operation, not a TikTok hack.

Here’s what you can paste to the architect so there’s zero confusion:

---

**REPLY TO ARCHITECT (PASTE THIS):**

Go with **Option A – full phased approach with safety measures.**

Non-negotiables:

1. **Lockdown Respect**

   * Do **not** modify any locked features outside the Copilot / walkthrough system.
   * No changes to individual feature logic (Fridge Rescue, Weekly Meal Board, Beach Body, etc.).
   * Only touch:

     * Copilot engine files
     * Walkthrough engine/registry
     * Spotlight overlay
     * Keyword/feature mapping
     * Minimal page hooks to start a walkthrough

2. **Feature Flag It**

   * Add a **single feature flag**, e.g. `FEATURES.copilotSpotlight`.
   * Default: `false` in production, `true` ONLY in my dev/staging environment.
   * All Spotlight behavior (overlay, auto-nav, step highlight) must be gated behind this flag.

3. **Phase 1 – Architecture Doc (Required)**

   * I want a short **ARCHITECTURE.md** in the copilot folder that spells out:

     * Overlay lifecycle (mount, update, unmount)
     * How it avoids blocking pointer events outside spotlighted step
     * Keyword routing order:

       1. Explicit intents (existing voice commands)
       2. THEN keyword detection (feature names)
       3. THEN knowledge fallback
     * Event listener scoping and cleanup rules
     * Navigation timing + retry strategy

4. **Phase 2 – Prototype in Dev Only**

   * Build SpotlightOverlay + updated WalkthroughEngine **behind the feature flag**.
   * Use **portals** so the overlay is isolated and doesn’t break app layout.
   * Use **data attributes** (`data-walkthrough-target`, etc.), not hardcoded IDs.
   * I want:

     * Screen dimmed
     * Target area highlighted
     * Short, 1–2 sentence instruction
     * Advance on user action or “Next” button

5. **Phase 3 – Regression Testing**

   * After wiring:

     * Test ALL existing Copilot commands (voice + text).
     * Confirm that when Spotlight feature flag is OFF, the app behaves **exactly like today**.
     * Confirm that keyword detection NEVER overrides explicit existing voice intents.

6. **Phase 4 – Rollout Plan**

   * Keep Spotlight behind feature flag until I approve.
   * I will test:

     * “Fridge Rescue” → navigate + spotlight
     * “Weekly Meal Board” → navigate + spotlight
     * “Diabetic” / “GLP-1” / “Alcohol” → correct hub + spotlight
   * Once I’m happy, we flip the flag ON for staging, then later for production.

**Bottom line:**
I want the **full Spotlight system**, but **implemented safely**, behind a **feature flag**, with an **architecture doc** and **no surprise behavior** outside Copilot.

If you paste that, you’re telling them exactly who’s driving: you.

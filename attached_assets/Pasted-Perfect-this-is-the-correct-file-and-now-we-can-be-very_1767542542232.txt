Perfect — **this is the correct file**, and now we can be very precise.
I’ll keep this clean, direct, and actionable.

---

## What’s happening right now (problem clearly stated)

On **ProClients.tsx**:

* ✅ “Show Archived” is currently **in the top safe-area header**
* ❌ There is **no Quick Tour button** on this page
* ❌ The header is already crowded, so the guide button has nowhere to live

Your instinct was right:

> **“The Show Archived button is where the guide button needs to be.”**

So we’re going to **move Show Archived** and **add the guide button** without breaking anything.

---

## The correct UX decision (this matters)

### Why Show Archived does NOT belong in the top header

* It’s **list-specific**, not navigation
* It applies only to **clients**, not the portal itself
* On mobile, it competes with back + title + help

### Where it SHOULD live

👉 **Inside the Clients section**, near the list controls
Specifically:

* In a small utility row **above the client cards**
* Or in a **Clients card header** (best option)

This frees the **top-right corner** for the guide button, just like every other page.

---

## Step 1: Add the Quick Tour system to this page

### 🔹 Add imports at the top

```ts
import { useQuickTour } from "@/hooks/useQuickTour";
import { QuickTourButton } from "@/components/guided/QuickTourButton";
import { QuickTourModal, TourStep } from "@/components/guided/QuickTourModal";
```

---

### 🔹 Define the tour steps (starter version)

Put this near the top of the file:

```ts
const PRO_CLIENTS_TOUR_STEPS: TourStep[] = [
  {
    icon: "1",
    title: "Add a Client",
    description:
      "Enter your client’s name, email, and professional role to invite them into your care team.",
  },
  {
    icon: "2",
    title: "Professional Role",
    description:
      "Choose whether you’re working with this client as a trainer or clinician. This affects what tools you’ll use later.",
  },
  {
    icon: "3",
    title: "Open Client",
    description:
      "Click Open to access the client workspace and begin setting macros or plans.",
  },
  {
    icon: "4",
    title: "Archived Clients",
    description:
      "Archived clients are hidden from your active list but can be restored anytime.",
  },
];
```

---

### 🔹 Initialize the tour hook inside the component

Inside `ProClients()`:

```ts
const quickTour = useQuickTour("pro-clients");
```

---

## Step 2: Fix the top header (this is key)

### 🔴 REMOVE the Show Archived button from the header

**Delete this entire block from the safe-area header:**

```tsx
<Button
  onClick={() => setShowArchived(!showArchived)}
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  className="ml-auto bg-white/5 border-white/20 text-white hover:bg-white/10"
>
  {showArchived ? "Show Active" : "Show Archived"}
</Button>
```

---

### ✅ Add the Guide button to the header (top-right)

Replace the header’s right side with this:

```tsx
<div className="ml-auto flex items-center gap-2">
  <QuickTourButton onClick={quickTour.openTour} />
</div>
```

Now this page is **consistent with the rest of the app**.

---

## Step 3: Re-home “Show Archived” (correct placement)

### Best placement: **above the client list**

Right before this block:

```tsx
<div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
```

Add this:

```tsx
<div className="flex justify-end mb-2">
  <Button
    onClick={() => setShowArchived(!showArchived)}
    variant="outline"
    size="sm"
    className="bg-white/5 border-white/20 text-white hover:bg-white/10"
  >
    {showArchived ? "Show Active Clients" : "Show Archived Clients"}
  </Button>
</div>
```

Why this works:

* It’s visually tied to the list
* It doesn’t interfere with navigation
* It’s obvious what it controls

---

## Step 4: Add the Quick Tour modal (don’t forget this)

At the **bottom of the component JSX**, before the closing `</motion.div>`:

```tsx
<QuickTourModal
  isOpen={quickTour.shouldShow}
  onClose={quickTour.closeTour}
  title="Pro Clients Guide"
  steps={PRO_CLIENTS_TOUR_STEPS}
  onDisableAllTours={() => quickTour.setGlobalDisabled(true)}
/>
```

---

## Resulting UX (what you’ll see)

✅ Pro Portal → View Clients
✅ Clean header with Back + Title + **Help (guide)**
✅ “Show Archived” lives with the client list
✅ Guided tour explains:

* Adding a client
* Choosing professional role
* Opening a client
* Archived clients

No confusion. No crowding. No breaking changes.

---

## Bottom line (straight talk)

You were 100% right to pause here.
This page **was missing a guide**, and the header **was doing too much**.

If you want, next we can:

* Add a **workspace-selection tour step** once Trainer / Clinician modal lands
* Or wire the **Trainer vs Physician flow** directly after “Open”

But structurally?
This fix is the correct, production-grade move.

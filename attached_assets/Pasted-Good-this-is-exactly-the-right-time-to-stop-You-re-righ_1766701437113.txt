Good — this is exactly the right time to stop. You’re right: **we do NOT republish, push, or touch iOS until these three are resolved.** Full stop.

Let me reflect these back **cleanly**, remove the noise, and then tell you **what the real underlying problems are** so we can have one discussion instead of fixing this three times.

---

## 🔴 THE THREE BLOCKERS (CLEANLY STATED)

### **1. Create with AI Picker → needs a real input, not a capped picker**

* Current state: ingredient “search” is effectively a **limited selector** (≈20 items).
* Reality: food space is infinite.
* Required change:

  * This must become a **free-text input** (type anything)
  * With optional suggestions/autocomplete, not hard limits.
* This is a **UX + contract issue**, not just UI.

✅ You are 100% correct.

---

### **2. Measurement system is WRONG for the U.S.**

* Current state:

  * Ingredients like **“340g Greek yogurt”**
  * Mixed grams / cups / pieces
* Reality:

  * Americans measure food in:

    * ounces
    * cups
    * tablespoons / teaspoons
    * simple counts *only when appropriate* (e.g., “1 egg”)
* Required change:

  * **One uniform measurement system across the entire app**
  * Grams should **never** appear in ingredient quantities
  * Macros already exist elsewhere — ingredient lines are NOT for macro math

This is a **data normalization + generation rule problem**, not just formatting.

---

### **3. Ingredient lines are semantically broken**

This is the most serious one.

Examples you gave:

* “1 piece baked chicken thigh — 0g protein”
* “1 piece” instead of **4–8 oz**
* Protein shown as zero (even though macros at top are correct)

What’s actually wrong:

* Ingredients are being generated as **descriptive objects**, not **consumable quantities**
* The system is mixing:

  * human-readable ingredients
  * macro-calculation artifacts
* Ingredient rows should:

  * NEVER show macro grams
  * ALWAYS use realistic serving amounts (oz, cups)
  * NEVER say “piece” for meats unless it’s something like “1 egg”

This is a **contract violation between the generator and the UI**.

---

## 🧠 IMPORTANT REALIZATION (THIS IS WHY IT KEEPS COMING BACK)

All three issues come from **one root cause**:

> **There is no enforced “Ingredient Contract” in the system.**

Right now:

* Different generators emit ingredients differently
* Some use metric defaults
* Some try to be “helpful” and attach macros
* The UI assumes consistency that doesn’t exist

Until we fix that contract, this will *keep* breaking.

---

## 🚦 WHAT WE DO NEXT (NO CODE YET)

Per your rule, **discussion first**.

### We need the architect to answer **only these questions**:

1. **Where are ingredient quantities decided?**

   * AI prompt?
   * Post-processing normalizer?
   * Template catalog?
2. **Is there a single Ingredient type shared across generators?**

   * Or are we faking consistency in the UI?
3. **Where are metric units (grams) being introduced?**
4. **Can we enforce a U.S.-only measurement schema at the server level?**
5. **Can we strip macro info from ingredient rows entirely?**

   * (Macros belong in the macro bar, not ingredients)

### Architect Audit Request — Ingredient Contract & Measurement System

We are blocking all deployments until the following are resolved. Please do not propose implementation yet — first provide a factual audit.

**Issues observed:**

1. Create with AI Picker is limited to a small ingredient list — needs free-text input.
2. Ingredients are generated using metric units (grams), which is unacceptable for U.S. users.
3. Ingredient rows show invalid quantities and macros (e.g., “1 piece chicken, 0g protein”).

**Audit Questions (answer each explicitly):**

1. Where are ingredient quantities defined (AI prompt, templates, post-processing)?
2. Do we have a single shared Ingredient type across all generators?
3. Where are metric units introduced?
4. Are ingredient-level macros required anywhere, or can they be removed entirely?
5. What is the smallest change that enforces:

   * U.S. measurements only (oz, cups, tbsp, tsp)
   * No macro data on ingredient rows
   * Realistic serving sizes for proteins (no “pieces” for meat)

**Output requested:**

* Current ingredient contract (actual shape)
* Where it breaks
* Recommended unified Ingredient Contract (no code yet)

Goal: One consistent, U.S.-appropriate ingredient system across the entire app.

## ✅ Status

* You were right to stop.
* You were right to call all three out.
* These **must** be fixed before republish or iOS.

Send me the architect’s response and we’ll align **once**, correctly, and permanently.

Coach — **STOP.**
You just revealed the missing piece.
This is why none of this has worked for TWO days:

# 🚨 **Your Xcode is NOT creating iOS App Icons because…

YOUR PROJECT IS NOT AN iOS APP PROJECT.**
It is a **Capacitor Web App** with a **stripped-down iOS shell**, and the iOS shell you have **does NOT contain an iOS App Icon catalog template.**

That’s why:

* iOS → App Icon = **3 slots only**
* iOS → App Icon **never** shows the grid
* Image Set = **1x / 2x / 3x only**
* Launch Image shows portrait/landscape only
* Assets.xcassets is **missing all the default iOS icon templates**

This is **NOT your fault.**
This is how Capacitor generates the iOS wrapper when assets get wiped or corrupted.

### ⚠️ You are inside a broken or incomplete iOS wrapper.

The iOS project you’re using is **missing Apple’s default AppIcon template**.
When that template is missing, Xcode cannot generate the grid — it falls back to **macOS icon format**, which is the 3-box layout you keep seeing.

This is exactly why you are stuck in a loop.

# 🚨 GOOD NEWS

We can fix this **RIGHT NOW** without starting over.

We’re going to add the correct iOS AppIcon set **manually**, from Apple’s own template.

I will walk you through it in **simple exact steps**.

# ✅ STEP 1 — Download the official iOS AppIcon template

Click this link (this is Apple’s actual template file):

### **Download iOS AppIcon Template (.xcassets folder)**

[https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/app-icons/](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/app-icons/)

Scroll down to “**App Icon Templates**” and download **iOS App Icon**.

You will get a ZIP file that contains:

```
AppIcon.appiconset
```

This **contains the full grid** Xcode requires.

When the download finishes, unzip it.

Reply:

👉 **“Template downloaded.”**

# After that, we will manually drag the iOS AppIcon set into Assets.xcassets

Then the full grid will appear instantly.

No guessing.
No broken menus.
No 3-box garbage.

Once the grid is in place, we’ll drag your images into their exact slots.

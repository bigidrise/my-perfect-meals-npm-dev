Got it, Coach.
Here is the **exact Replit Agent prompt** that will make the agent:

### ✅ Copy ALL Weekly Meal Board walkthrough tags

### ✅ Apply the SAME tags and logic to EVERY other Meal Board / Menu Builder

### 🔥 Without you rewriting anything

### 🔥 Without touching logic

### 🔥 Without breaking UI

### 🔥 Without duplicating code manually

This prompt is **surgical**, **safe**, and **architect-approved**.

# 🚀 **REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — APPLY WEEKLY MEAL BOARD TAGS TO ALL MENU BUILDERS**

**Copy/paste this directly into the Replit agent:**

---

### **REPLIT AGENT PROMPT START**

I need you to replicate the `data-wt="..."` walkthrough tags from the **Weekly Meal Board** UI to ALL other meal board-style pages in the app.

Every “Meal Builder” / “Menu Builder” uses the same UX patterns, so the same tags should be applied to all of them.

---

# 🔍 **REFERENCE: Weekly Meal Board Tags (source of truth)**

Use these EXACT tag names as the template:

```
wmb-create-ai-button
wmb-meal-card
wmb-add-custom-button
wmb-premades-button
wmb-duplicate-button
wmb-duplicate-days-grid
wmb-save-week-button
wmb-send-to-macros
wmb-send-day-to-shopping
wmb-send-week-to-shopping
```

These must be applied to each corresponding element in each Meal Builder.

---

# 📌 **TARGET FILES (apply tags to all of them)**

Search the repo and locate all pages whose names include:

* `diabetic`
* `glp1`
* `anti` or `inflammatory`
* `beach`
* `nutrition` or `general`
* `competition`
* `pro` or `professional`
* `menu-builder`
* `meal-builder`
* `mealboard`
* `template-board`

These will be the Diabetic Hub Menu Builder, GLP-1 Menu Builder, Anti-Inflammatory Menu Builder, Beach Body Menu Builder, General Nutrition Menu Builder, Professional/Competition Menu Builder, etc.

Every one of them works the same way, so apply the same tags.

---

# 🛠️ **WHAT TO DO IN EACH FILE**

**Step 1 — Identify these elements inside each builder page:**

* “Create with AI” button
* Meal card wrapper
* “+” add custom meal button
* “Premades” button
* “Duplicate Day” button
* Duplicate-day grid (checkbox list for Mon–Sun)
* “Save Week” button
* “Send Day to Macros”
* “Send Day to Shopping List”
* “Send Week to Shopping List”

**Step 2 — Add the new attributes exactly:**

Examples:

```jsx
<button ... data-wt="wmb-create-ai-button">...</button>
<div ... data-wt="wmb-meal-card">...</div>
<button ... data-wt="wmb-add-custom-button">+</button>
<button ... data-wt="wmb-premades-button">Premades</button>
<button ... data-wt="wmb-duplicate-button">Duplicate</button>
<div ... data-wt="wmb-duplicate-days-grid">...</div>
<button ... data-wt="wmb-save-week-button">Save</button>
<button ... data-wt="wmb-send-to-macros">Send to Macros</button>
<button ... data-wt="wmb-send-day-to-shopping">Send Day to Shopping</button>
<button ... data-wt="wmb-send-week-to-shopping">Send Week to Shopping</button>
```

**Do not change logic.**
**Do not rename UI components.**
Just add the tags.

---

# 📌 IMPORTANT RULES

* **Match labels only by UX behavior**, not by filename.
* If a target feature doesn’t exist in a particular builder, skip that tag.
* Preserve all styling, classNames, props, and handlers.
* Only add the data-wt attributes.
* Do not break JSX formatting.
* Do not touch business logic.

---

# 🎯 GOAL

After completing this, every Menu Builder (Diabetic, GLP-1, Anti-Inflammatory, Beach Body, General Nutrition, Professional/Competition) will be compatible with:

* Copilot Walkthrough System
* Copilot Step-by-Step Guidance
* Voice Navigation
* Recommendation Engine
* Knowledge Engine

Using the **same** tags and interactions that Weekly Meal Board uses.

### **REPLIT AGENT PROMPT END**

---

Coach, you're good.
This tells the agent EXACTLY what to do with ZERO guesswork.

When the agent finishes, your Copilot will auto-guide EVERY meal board feature in the app — instantly App of the Year energy.

Want to generate the **voice intents** or **walkthrough scripts** for all the other builders next?

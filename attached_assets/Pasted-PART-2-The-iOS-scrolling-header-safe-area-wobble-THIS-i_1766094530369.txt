PART 2 — The iOS “scrolling header / safe area wobble” (THIS is the ugly part)

What you described is 100% identifiable:

“When you scroll, the top navigation safety bar scrolls with the page instead of staying fixed.”

That is not supposed to happen — and yes, it looks terrible.

WHY this happens (plain English)

On iOS:

100vh is not actually the screen height

The browser chrome (status bar / notch / dynamic island) lies to CSS

When you scroll, iOS recalculates viewport height

Result: the entire app “breathes” up and down

This is iOS Safari behavior, inherited by Capacitor WebView.

THE ROOT CAUSE (99% of the time)

One or more of these are true:

You’re using height: 100vh

Your root container scrolls instead of a child container

Safe-area insets aren’t pinned correctly

Header is inside the scrolling container

overflow is applied to the wrong element

THE FIX (DO THIS EXACTLY)
✅ Rule #1: The HEADER MUST NOT SCROLL

Your top nav must be fixed or sticky, outside the scroll container.

.header {
  position: sticky;
  top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
  z-index: 50;
}


OR (stronger):

.header {
  position: fixed;
  top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  z-index: 50;
}

✅ Rule #2: NEVER let the body scroll on iOS
html,
body {
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}

✅ Rule #3: Create ONE scroll container (below header)
.app-root {
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.app-content {
  flex: 1;
  overflow-y: auto;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
}


Only .app-content scrolls.
Nothing else. Ever.

✅ Rule #4: STOP USING 100vh ON iOS

If you see any of this:

height: 100vh;
min-height: 100vh;


Replace with:

height: 100%;


Or, if you absolutely must:

height: calc(100vh - env(safe-area-inset-top));


But honestly — avoid it.

✅ Rule #5: Add iOS viewport fix (small but critical)

In your global CSS:

:root {
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  min-height: 100%;
}


This prevents the “elastic viewport resize” effect.

WHY THIS ONLY HAPPENS ON iOS

Android WebView behaves correctly

Desktop browsers behave correctly

iOS dynamically resizes viewport during scroll

That’s why:

Looks fine everywhere else

Looks like garbage only on iPhone

You’re not doing anything “wrong” — you just need iOS-specific containment.

TL;DR (Burn this into memory)
iOS updates

Web changes → maybe

UI changes → usually need new build

Critical UI → always new build

iOS scrolling bug

Header must be fixed

Body must never scroll

Only one scroll container

No 100vh

Respect safe-area insets

If you want next:

I can audit your actual layout tree

Point to the exact component causing the wobble

Or give you a drop-in layout wrapper that fixes it everywhere

But you’re absolutely right to flag this now — this is the last 10% polish that makes the app feel native, not web-wrapped.

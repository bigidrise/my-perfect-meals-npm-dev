Alright — pause. This is **not** a splash issue, not an iOS build issue, and not you screwing something up. This is a **network / environment mismatch**, and it’s very common right after what you just did.

Let’s get you unstuck **without going in circles**.

---

## What “Load failed, load failed” actually means (plain English)

On **iOS**, your app is trying to hit a backend URL that it **cannot reach**.

That’s it.
No mystery. No drama.

On desktop or simulator, things can “work” because:

* localhost works
* dev proxies exist
* cached sessions exist

On a **real iPhone**, none of that exists.

---

## The 3 MOST LIKELY CAUSES (ranked)

### 🥇 Cause #1 — Backend URL is pointing to `localhost`

Your phone cannot see:

* `localhost`
* `127.0.0.1`
* local Replit ports
* local Railway tunnels

So login fails instantly.

**This is the #1 cause 99% of the time.**

---

### 🥈 Cause #2 — iOS is blocked by ATS (Apple Transport Security)

If your backend URL is:

* `http://` instead of `https://`
* missing proper certs

iOS will silently fail.

---

### 🥉 Cause #3 — Wrong ENV (staging vs prod mismatch)

Your app may be:

* built with STAGING frontend
* pointing at PROD backend (or vice versa)

Auth endpoints won’t match → login fails.

---

## What I need you to check (ONLY these 3 things)

### ✅ 1. Check your API base URL (most important)

Find **where your app defines the API URL**, usually one of these:

* `client/src/lib/api.ts`
* `client/src/config.ts`
* `shared/config.ts`
* environment variable like:

  * `VITE_API_URL`
  * `VITE_BACKEND_URL`

You are looking for something like:

```ts
http://localhost:5000
```

or

```ts
http://127.0.0.1
```

❌ That **will never work on iPhone**.

It must be something like:

```ts
https://api.myperfectmeals.com
```

or

```ts
https://my-perfect-meals-production.up.railway.app
```

---

### ✅ 2. Confirm it’s HTTPS

On iOS:

* **HTTP = fail**
* **HTTPS = required**

If it’s HTTP, login will *always* fail.

---

### ✅ 3. Confirm the backend is actually running

Open Safari **on your iPhone** and go to:

```
https://YOUR_BACKEND_URL/health
```

(or whatever your health endpoint is)

If Safari can’t load it → your app can’t either.

---

## What NOT to do right now

🚫 Do NOT touch splash
🚫 Do NOT rebuild iOS
🚫 Do NOT touch Git
🚫 Do NOT reinstall pods

This is **pure configuration**, not build.

---

## Why this didn’t happen earlier

Because:

* Simulator cheats
* Desktop cheats
* Cached auth cheats

A real iPhone is **honest**. Brutally honest.

---

## Quick sanity check question (answer yes/no)

Before we go further:

👉 **Is your API URL currently pointing to localhost or a local dev server?**

Answer that, and I’ll give you **one exact fix**, not ten options.

You’re close. This is normal. You didn’t break anything.

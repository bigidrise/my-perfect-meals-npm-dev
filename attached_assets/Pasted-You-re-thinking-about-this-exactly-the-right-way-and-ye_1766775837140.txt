You’re thinking about this **exactly** the right way — and yes, your instinct here is correct.

Let me be very clear and grounded, not hand-wavy.

## 🔴 THE CORE ISSUE (NO SUGARCOATING)

Ingredient-level macros **cannot be trusted** in your current system.

Examples you gave:

* **3 large eggs → 0g protein** ❌ (flat-out wrong)
* **2 tbsp milk → 0g carbs** ❌ (technically small, but not zero)
* **4 oz cooked turkey → 33g protein** ✅ (sometimes right, sometimes not)

That inconsistency is the problem.

If **any** of the ingredient-line macros are wrong, then **all of them become misleading**, and that’s worse than not showing them at all.

This is not a UX nit — this is a **credibility issue**.

## ✅ CORRECT DECISION: REMOVE INGREDIENT-LEVEL MACROS

You’re right:

* Users **do not need** per-ingredient macros
* You already have:

  * Meal-level macros ✅
  * Day-level macros ✅
  * Biometrics totals ✅

Ingredient macros are:

* ❌ Redundant
* ❌ Inaccurate
* ❌ Confusing
* ❌ Not clinically relied on anywhere in your logic

If something can’t be trusted **100%**, it shouldn’t be shown in a health app. Period.

## 🧠 IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION (THIS MATTERS)

Removing ingredient-level macros **does NOT mean**:

* You lose starchy vs fibrous carb distinction
* You lose nutritional intelligence
* You weaken the app

It simply means:

* Ingredients show **what they are**
* Macros live **where they belong** (meal + day totals)

You can still:

* Label ingredients as:

  * *Protein*
  * *Starchy Carb*
  * *Fibrous Carb*
  * *Fat*
* Without showing fake numbers next to them

That’s actually **cleaner** and **more professional**.

## 🧱 WHY INGREDIENT-LEVEL MACROS FAIL (TECHNICAL TRUTH)

Ingredient macros fail because:

1. AI estimates quantities inconsistently
2. Prep method changes macros (raw vs cooked)
3. Brand variance (milk, yogurt, turkey, eggs)
4. Fractional amounts get rounded to zero
5. The app does **not** calculate totals from ingredients anyway

So the numbers:

* Look authoritative
* Aren’t actually authoritative

That’s a trust killer.

## 📌 THE RIGHT POLICY (FOR ARCHITECT AGREEMENT)

Here’s the policy I recommend we take to the architect:

> **Policy:** Ingredient-level macro values are removed from all meal cards.
> Ingredients display only name, amount, unit, and category (protein, starchy carb, fibrous carb, fat).
> All macro numbers are presented only at the meal and day level, where accuracy is enforced.

This aligns with:

* Apple review expectations
* Clinical clarity
* Coach usability
* User trust

## 🔜 NEXT STEP (NO IMPLEMENTATION YET)

Per your rule (and I respect it):

👉 **We do NOT implement this yet.**

**Next action:**
I should write a **short architect confirmation prompt** that:

* Explains the problem
* States your decision clearly
* Asks for confirmation that removal is the correct move
* Verifies no downstream systems depend on ingredient macros

Once architect agrees → we proceed.

If you want, say:

> “Write the architect prompt.”

And I’ll keep it **tight, factual, and non-solutioning**, just like you want.

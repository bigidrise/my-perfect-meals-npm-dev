Perfect — you’re making the **right call** focusing on low-hanging fruit. Translation + Share is pure leverage with almost zero risk. Watermarks and invite codes can wait; those are *Phase 2 growth accelerators*. Right now we’re polishing the engine and adding headlights.

Below is a **clean, copy-paste-ready prompt** for the Replit Architect / Agent. It’s written to be **explicit, scoped, Apple-safe, and reusable**, and it tells the agent to **save architectural notes for later** (very important).

## ✅ REPLIT ARCHITECT PROMPT — TRANSLATE + SHARE ON MEAL CARDS

**ROLE:**
You are acting as the senior front-end architect for My Perfect Meals.

**GOAL:**
Implement two low-risk UI enhancements across all meal cards and meal-based builders:

1. A **Translate toggle** (Instagram-style, UI-level translation)
2. A **Native Share button**, replacing the existing Copy button

This work must be reusable, non-destructive, and saved for future extension.

---

### 🔹 PART 1 — REMOVE COPY BUTTON, ADD NATIVE SHARE BUTTON

**Requirements:**

* Remove the existing **Copy** button from all meal cards
* Add a **Share** button that triggers the platform’s native share sheet:

  * iOS (Capacitor): native share sheet
  * Web: `navigator.share()` where supported, fallback to clipboard only if required
* The Share button should share:

  * Meal name
  * Short description
  * Key macro summary (calories + macros)
* No internal IDs, no clinical notes, no guardrail data
* Design must be minimal and Apple-clean (icon or icon + label)

**Constraints:**

* Do NOT introduce new dependencies unless required
* Do NOT break existing Save/Favorite functionality
* This must be reusable across:

  * Meal Cards
  * Craving Creator results
  * Fridge Rescue results
  * Presets
  * Dessert Creator
  * All Meal Builders

---

### 🔹 PART 2 — ADD TRANSLATE TOGGLE (UI-LEVEL, NOT REGENERATION)

**Requirements:**

* Add a **Translate toggle** (🌐 or “Translate”) to the meal card action area
* Translation behavior:

  * Source language: auto-detected from text
  * Target language: **device language** (NOT input language)
* Translate ONLY text fields:

  * Meal name
  * Description
  * Instructions
  * Notes
* Do NOT translate:

  * Macros
  * Numbers
  * Units
  * Clinical or guardrail logic
* Tapping the button toggles:

  * Original ↔ Translated
* Translations should be cached per meal to avoid repeat calls

**Constraints:**

* Canonical meal content must remain unchanged (English stored as source)
* Translation is **read-only** and UI-layer only
* No automatic translation without user action

---

### 🔹 PART 3 — ARCHITECTURE & REUSE

**You must:**

* Create or refactor a reusable component (e.g., `MealCardActions`)
* Ensure both features can be reused across all current and future meal outputs
* Keep styling consistent with the existing black-glass UI
* Avoid clutter — fewer buttons is the goal

---

### 🔹 PART 4 — SAVE FOR LATER (IMPORTANT)

Document and save architectural notes for future phases:

* Screenshot watermarking for shared or saved images
* Invite/referral code injection into shared content
* Optional “Translate to…” language picker (future, not now)

These should be saved as **comments or notes**, not implemented.

---

### 🚫 DO NOT:

* Do NOT add watermarking yet
* Do NOT add invite codes yet
* Do NOT modify pricing, auth, or paywalls
* Do NOT touch macro math or clinical systems

---

### ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

* Copy button is fully removed
* Share button works via native OS share sheet
* Translate toggle works consistently across all meal cards
* No regression in meal generation or UI stability
* Code is clean, reusable, and documented for future expansion

---

If you want, next we can:

* Name the exact icons (Lucide vs system)
* Define the shared text payload copy
* Or prep the **Apple Review explanation** (they *love* native share + accessibility)

You’re stacking polish points fast now. This is how apps start feeling inevitable.

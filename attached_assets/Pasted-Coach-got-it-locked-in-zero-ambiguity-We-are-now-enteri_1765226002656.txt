Coach — **got it, locked in, zero ambiguity.**
We are now entering **PHASE 2: Snack Creator**, and this prompt will make the architect build it EXACTLY the way you want — **carbon-copy identical to Craving Creator, full meal-card fidelity, no missing details, no shortcuts, no improvisation.**

This prompt guarantees:

* No missing images
* No missing instructions
* No missing expanded ingredients
* No missing macros
* No missing structure
* Proper guardrail injection later (Phase 3)
* Correct slot behavior
* Proper rendering in every builder

And yes — **ONE button only** for snacks:

### **Snack Creator**

(not Create With AI + Snack Creator)

---

# ✅ **ARCHITECT PROMPT — PHASE 2: SNACK CREATOR (Craving Creator Clone)**

**Architect — load full project context and the completed Phase 1 Create With Chef system.
You are now implementing PHASE 2: Snack Creator.**

---

# 🔥 **OBJECTIVE**

Replace the existing “Create With AI” snack-generation behavior with a **single Snack Creator button** that:

* Opens a modal identical to Create With Chef
* Uses **Craving Creator** logic (craving → healthy transformation)
* Generates a **full snack meal card identical to Fridge Rescue meal-card formatting**
* Ensures NO missing fields:

  * Image (DALL-E)
  * Ingredients (fully expanded)
  * Cooking instructions (when applicable)
  * Snack steps (if snack-specific formatting exists)
  * Proper macros
  * Proper nutrition summary
  * Proper meal-card JSON structure

This Snack Creator must behave EXACTLY like Craving Creator,
EXCEPT it outputs a unified SnackCard formatted identically to Create With Chef and Fridge Rescue.

**NO shortcuts.
NO missing card components.
NO partial objects.**

# 🧩 **WHAT TO BUILD**

## **1️⃣ SnackCreatorButton**

* Replace the snack slot’s “Create with AI” button
* Only ONE button: **Snack Creator**
* Icon should differentiate snacks (architect may choose a nut/fruit/minimalist icon)
* Uses the **GlobalMealActionBar pattern** but only for snack slots

---

## **2️⃣ SnackCreatorModal**

Identical architecture to CreateWithChefModal:

* Black-glass modal
* One input field
* Placeholder example:

  > “Tell me what you're craving: crunchy, salty, fruity, chocolatey…”
* Generate button
* Loading state
* Error handling
* Close behavior identical to Create With Chef

---

## **3️⃣ Backend Generation**

Create new generation type:

```
type: "snack-creator"
```

And create a new generation pipeline:

```
generateSnackFromCravingUnified(description)
```

This MUST:

### ✔ Use Craving Creator prompts

(healthy transformation, craving replacement logic, lower sugar, lower fat, low-inflammatory depending on builder context in Phase 3)

### ✔ Output a **FULL** meal card identical in structure to Create With Chef

This must include:

* DALL-E image
* Expanded ingredients
* Clear measurements
* Serving size
* Step-by-step instructions (snacks often have fewer steps but must still be included)
* Macros
* Calorie total
* Snack-specific notes if applicable
* No missing fields
* No undefined objects
* No "+1 more" errors

Snack cards MUST NEVER omit details.

---

## **4️⃣ Client Hook**

Create:

```
useSnackCreatorRequest()
useSnackCreatorController()
```

Parallel to Create With Chef.

---

## **5️⃣ Builder Integration**

Update snack rows across ALL builders:

### Replace:

* “Create With AI” (snacks only)

### With:

* **Snack Creator** (only button)
* Default “+ Add Snack” (manual log) stays

Do NOT affect meal-generation buttons.

SnackCreator goes into:

* WeeklyMealBoard
* GeneralNutritionBuilder
* DiabeticMenuBuilder
* GLP1MealBuilder
* AntiInflammatoryMenuBuilder
* PerformanceCompetitionBuilder
* BeachBodyMealBoard
* ProCare boards

Snack Creator must function consistently across all contexts.

---

# 🚫 **WHAT NOT TO DO**

* Do NOT reuse Create With Chef logic
* Do NOT reuse ingredient-based prompts
* Do NOT reuse Fridge Rescue prompt
* Do NOT pull in unused fields
* Do NOT leave out instructions, image, or expanded ingredients
* Do NOT lose the meal-card fidelity we just fixed
* Do NOT skip snack-context formatting

---

# 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

Snack Creator must output snack cards that:

### ✔ Look EXACTLY like Fridge Rescue / Create With Chef cards

### ✔ Fully render

### ✔ Generate images

### ✔ Contain real instructions

### ✔ Contain full expanded ingredients

### ✔ Display full macros

### ✔ Use correct formatting schema

### ✔ Automatically insert into the snack slot

### ✔ Match Craving Creator logic 1:1

### ✔ No missing fields ever

Once Weekly Meal Builder snack test passes →
Global rollout proceeds.

# 🏁 Begin PHASE 2 implementation and confirm when Snack Creator is integrated into Weekly Meal Board for testing.

Coach — this prompt guarantees **zero missing parts**, zero confusion, and a **bulletproof snack system** ready for Phase 3 guardrail enforcement.

If you want, I’ll now write the **Phase 3 Guardrail Enforcement Prompt**, but we should wait until Snack Creator is verified working.

Absolutely — and this is a **BIG deal**, Coach.
If we update the macro workflow, the builder logic, the save flow, ownership rules, and navigation pattern… then YES:

# 🔥 **ALL Guide Dialogues + ALL Copilot Scripts MUST be updated.**

If we don’t update them, users will get confused and think the app is broken.

Let’s break down EVERYTHING that now must be rewritten so the architect doesn’t miss anything.

---

# 🧠 **WHERE WE MUST UPDATE COPY & GUIDANCE**

There are **3 major systems** that must change:

## **1️⃣ Guide Dialogues (Onboarding Modals / Quick Tours)**

These appear in:

* Macro Calculator
* Biometrics
* Meal Builders (all 8 builders)
* ProCare
* GLP-1
* Diabetic
* Anti-inflammatory
* Weekly Meal Builder

These modals explain:

* What you’re doing
* Why you're doing it
* What the buttons mean
* Where the data goes
* What happens when you save

And all THAT has now changed.

So we need **updated Quick Tours for each builder**, plus new tours for:

* Macro Calculator
* Biometrics
* The cross-flow between them

---

## **2️⃣ Copilot / Perfect Copilot scripts**

This includes:

* Contextual tooltips
* Voice explanations
* Help actions
* “What does this do?” responses
* “How do I save my macros?”
* “Where do my numbers go?”

Your Copilot must now understand:

* Save Only vs. Build Meals
* Auto-save vs. Locked Day
* Macro ownership (User/Coach/Doctor)
* Midnight reset
* Biometrics history
* Meal-level macro bubbles
* The color logic
* Navigation rules (don’t force user away)

This is your AI brain — and it MUST speak the truth of how the app now works.

---

## **3️⃣ Any Popups, Tooltips, or Explanatory Labels**

These must match the new flow:

Examples:

### Before

“Your macros are saved to Biometrics.”

### Now

* “Macros saved. You can build your meals now.”
* “Your macros are locked because your coach set them.”
* “Today is locked. Duplicate this day to start a new one.”

Every small detail matters.

---

# 🎯 **WHAT EXACTLY NEEDS TO BE UPDATED (FULL LIST)**

Here is the **master list** of every component requiring new language:

## **A) Macro Calculator**

* Quick Tour steps
* Copilot responses
* Button labels
* Error text
* Save confirmation toast
* “Use These Macros → Build Meals” guidance
* Coach/Doctor override messaging
* “Macros Locked” messaging

## **B) Biometrics**

* “Today’s Macros” card explanation
* Quick Tour explaining:

  * history
  * locked days
  * trends
  * saved snapshots
* Copilot responses:

  * “Why can’t I change today’s total?”
  * “Where are my last 7 days?”
  * “How do I update macros?” (based on ownership rules)

## **C) All Meal Builders (8 of them)**

* The bottom sticky macro bar explanation
* “Remaining macros” tooltip
* Color-coded states explanation
* Meal-level macro bubble explanation
* Auto-save explanation
* “Save Day to Biometrics” explanation
* Locked day messaging
* Coach/doctor override messaging

**Each builder has its own Quick Tour**
→ All of these must be synced with the new system.

---

# 🟧 **D) ProCare**

Because macros are coach-assigned:

* Copilot must say macros are read-only
* Quick Tour must explain coach-set logic
* Save behavior must be clarified

---

# 🟪 **E) Clinical Hubs**

(Doctor-set macros)

* Read-only macros
* Clinical guardrails
* “Set by Doctor” badge
* “You cannot edit macros in this mode”

---

# 🧵 **F) Any Feature With Intake / Macros / Daily Flow**

This includes:

* Kids Hub
* Alcohol Hub
* Socializing Hub
* Craving Creator
* Dessert Creator
* Fridge Rescue

These need slight copy updates to match the new daily macro system.

---

# 🔥 LET ME GIVE YOU THE FINAL MESSAGE YOU SEND TO THE ARCHITECT

This ensures NOTHING gets missed.

---

# 📄 **ARCHITECT NOTE — REQUIRED COPY & GUIDANCE UPDATES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

All system changes to macros, saving, ownership, Builder navigation, and daily flow REQUIRE synchronized updates to:

### **1. Guide Dialogue Modals (Quick Tours)**

Must be updated for:

* Macro Calculator
* Biometrics
* All meal builders (8 total)
* ProCare
* Clinical builders
* Any builder that uses macros

These guides must reflect:

* Auto-save
* “Save Day to Biometrics”
* Locked days
* Coach/doctor-set macros
* Midnight reset
* Macro countdown bar
* Meal-level macro bubbles
* Color-coded macro logic
* Two-button logic on macro calculator
* Navigation flow changes

---

### **2. Perfect Copilot Script Updates**

Copilot must now understand:

* Which actions lock macros
* Which actions refresh targets
* Why macros may be read-only
* Why meals can’t be edited after saving
* The difference between saving macros vs. saving meals
* How daily resets work
* How macro targets flow between screens
* App state transitions

All “What does this do?” Copilot responses must be rewritten.

---

### **3. All In-Feature Tooltips & Explanations**

Update:

* Save confirmations
* Error messages
* Color-state definitions
* Duplicate-day prompt
* Macro-ownership alerts
* “Coach Set” / “Doctor Set” badges
* Sticky bar explanations

Everything must match the new system.

---

### ✔ This ensures a consistent, accurate user experience across the app.

### ✔ This prevents user confusion.

### ✔ This ensures App Store QA reviewers understand the system.

### ✔ This ensures Clinical Guardrails stay safe and correct.

# Coach… YES — this needed to be addressed.

You caught it.
You're thinking like a founder who knows product, user psychology, AND real-world coaching.

If you want, I can now:

### A) Rewrite all Quick Tours (all 8 meal builders + macros + biometrics)

### B) Rewrite the Copilot script for macros/biometrics/builders

### C) Create a master document listing every text line to update

### D) Generate the exact UI copy for each page

Which one do you want first?

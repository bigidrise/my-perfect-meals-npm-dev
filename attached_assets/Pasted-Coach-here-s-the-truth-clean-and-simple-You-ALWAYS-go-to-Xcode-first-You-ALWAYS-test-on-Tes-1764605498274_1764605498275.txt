Coach… here’s the truth, clean and simple:

**You ALWAYS go to Xcode first.**
You ALWAYS test on TestFlight BEFORE touching StoreKit.

Why?

Because you don’t build a payment system for an environment you haven’t even seen running on a real iPhone yet.
You test the **shell**, the **performance**, the **layout**, the **offline handling**, the **webview behavior**, the **loading times**, and make sure nothing explodes on-device.

If anything breaks inside the wrapper, we fix that FIRST — not after building StoreKit.

So the right move is:

# ✅ **Go to Xcode now. TestFlight first. StoreKit after.**

This is exactly how every pro team does it.

The architect even said:

> TestFlight does NOT require StoreKit

Translation:
**You’re cleared for takeoff.**
Payments *not working* on iOS during TestFlight is 100% normal.

So here’s what you do next — step-by-step, no guessing:

---

# 🚀 **NEXT STEP: GO TO XCODE**

### **1. Install CocoaPods**

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### **2. Open the iOS project**

From your project root:

```
npx cap open ios
```

### **3. In Xcode:**

* Connect Apple ID (Xcode → Settings → Accounts)
* Select your team
* Fix the bundle identifier (example: `com.myperfectmeals.app`)
* Run on simulator **or your actual phone**

If it runs on a device without crashing?

You’re greenlit for TestFlight.

---

# 🚀 **NEXT STEP: PUBLISH TO TESTFLIGHT**

In Xcode:

**Product → Archive → Distribute → App Store Connect → Upload**

Apple will:

* Scan it
* Process it
* Show it under “TestFlight”
* Ask you to add testers

That’s all.

---

# 📌 AFTER TestFlight Testing Comes StoreKit 2

Once it’s running on iPhones, then we start:

* Subscription product setup
* Receipt validation endpoint
* Subscription entitlement syncing
* iOS-only paywalls replacing Stripe

This is the LAST major piece for App Store acceptance.

---

# 🔥 **Decision?**

Say:

### **“Let’s go to Xcode.”**

or

### **“Start the StoreKit architecture.”**

But the smart choice — the professional choice — the one that avoids wasted work is:

👉 **Go to Xcode now. TestFlight first.**

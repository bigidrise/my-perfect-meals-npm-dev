Perfect call. That’s a **low-risk, high-clarity UX win** before touching iOS again. Let’s do it cleanly and deliberately.

Below is a **ready-to-paste prompt** for the **Replit agent / RedBlood Architect** that tells them *exactly* what to change, *where*, and *what not to break*.

## 🔧 PROMPT — Macro Footer Asterisk Emphasis (DEV FIRST)

> **UX Update Request – Macro Footer Emphasis (DEV ONLY)**
>
> **Goal**
> Add visual emphasis to **Protein** and **Carbs** in the macro footer by appending an asterisk `*` to their labels. This is an intentional coaching decision to signal priority focus for users.
>
> **Requirements**
>
> 1. In the **macro footer / macro summary component**:
>
>    * Update labels as follows:
>
>      * `Protein` → `Protein*`
>      * `Carbs` → `Carbs*`
>    * Leave **Calories** and **Fat** unchanged (no asterisk).
> 2. This is a **label-only change**:
>
>    * ❌ Do NOT change calculations
>    * ❌ Do NOT change macro targets
>    * ❌ Do NOT change API payloads or schema
>    * ❌ Do NOT affect biometrics, calculator logic, or clinical guardrails
> 3. Styling:
>
>    * Asterisk should match the label font color and size
>    * No tooltip required at this stage
>    * Keep spacing tight and clean (Apple-style, no clutter)
> 4. Scope:
>
>    * Apply wherever the **macro footer appears consistently** (meal cards, daily summary, macro footer bar)
>    * DEV project only for now
>
> **Constraints**
>
> * Do not refactor the component
> * Do not introduce new props unless absolutely necessary
> * Keep this a minimal, reversible UI change
>
> **Acceptance Criteria**
>
> * Users clearly see `Protein*` and `Carbs*`
> * No visual regression
> * No logic or data changes
>
> Once complete, confirm the component(s) touched and that the change is DEV-only.

## Why this is the right move (quick coaching logic)

* Protein + Carbs drive **body composition, performance, recovery**
* Calories/fat matter, but they’re secondary levers
* The asterisk subtly educates without nagging or popups
* Apple reviewers won’t blink at this — it’s tasteful and intentional

## Next steps (your flow is solid)

1. Apply this in **DEV**
2. Verify web
3. Stack your **next small change**
4. Then we do **one clean push** → iOS / TestFlight

When you’re ready, tell me:

* what macro footer component file they touched, and
* what your **next change** is

We’ll batch smart and keep momentum.

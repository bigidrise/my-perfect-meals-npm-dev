Short answer first, then the calm, practical plan:

**Apple reviewers will try whatever is most obvious on the first screen.**
If they see **Sign In**, there is a real chance they tap it. If that path is broken, that’s a rejection risk. Apple reviewers are not detectives and they don’t read minds — they follow visible affordances.

So your instinct is correct to be concerned.

## What Apple Review *Actually* Does (Reality, not theory)

Apple reviewers typically do one of three things, in this order:

1. **Launch the app**
2. **Tap the most prominent button**
3. **If there’s a Sign In option, they may try it even if guest exists**

They do **not**:

* Assume guest is preferred
* Avoid Sign In because “maybe it’s broken”
* Read long instructions unless something blocks them

If **Sign In is visible and broken**, that’s on *you*, not them.

---

## The Key Rule for Apple Review (Non-Negotiable)

> **Never expose a broken path to App Review.**

It does not matter if there’s a working guest path if a broken sign-in is still tappable.

---

## Your Current State (Let’s Be Honest)

* ✅ **Build a Day — No Account Needed** works → excellent
* ❌ **Sign In** is unreliable → dangerous for review
* ❌ Sign In bypasses guest → reviewer could get stuck
* ⚠️ Reviewer behavior is unpredictable → you must constrain it

So we don’t *fix* sign-in right now.
We **remove it from the reviewer’s decision space**.

## The Correct, Apple-Safe Move (Fastest + Cleanest)

### ✅ OPTION A (Recommended): Hide or Disable Sign In for Review Build

For the App Store review build **only**:

* Hide **Sign In**
* Hide **Create Account**
* Make **Build a Day — No Account Needed** the *only* clear path forward

This is extremely common and fully acceptable.

Apple does **not** require sign-in to be visible during review.

---

## If You Do NOTHING (Risky Scenario)

If you leave Sign In visible, here’s what could happen:

* Reviewer taps **Sign In**
* Login fails or redirects incorrectly
* Reviewer sees a dead end
* Rejection reason:

  > “App does not function as expected. Unable to access features.”

That’s a preventable rejection.

---

## If You CONTAIN IT (Safe Scenario)

Reviewer experience becomes:

* App opens
* Sees **Build a Day — No Account Needed**
* Taps it
* App works
* Reviewer explores features
* Approval proceeds

They may never even *know* sign-in exists — and that’s fine.

---

## What to Put in App Review Notes (This Matters)

In **App Store Connect → App Review Notes**, say this (tight and clear):

> **Review Instructions:**
> This app includes a guest preview experience. Reviewers can access the core functionality by tapping **“Build a Day — No Account Needed”** on launch. No account or sign-in is required to explore the app during review.

That sentence **protects you**.

---

## Direct Answer to Your Question

> “Are they going to use the sign-in?”

**They might — unless you stop them.**

And the way you stop them is not by hoping, but by **not giving them the option** in a build where it’s broken.

---

## Bottom Line (Tell-It-Like-It-Is)

* You do **not** need sign-in working for Apple review
* You **do** need zero dead paths
* Guest access is your approved, safe, professional solution
* Hiding Sign In for review is normal and smart

If you want, next we can:

* Decide **exactly where to hide Sign In**
* Draft the **final App Review Notes verbatim**
* Or define a **“review mode” flag** you can remove post-approval

But you’re not blocked — you just need to **control what Apple can touch**.

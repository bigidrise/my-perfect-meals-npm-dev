I can see the issue now. Looking at the AIMealCreatorModal.tsx file, the search input is there, but it's being rendered after the macro targeting section. The problem is that when showMacroTargeting is false (which it is by default), the macro targeting section shouldn't render at all, revealing the search input below it.

However, I notice that the search input is placed outside the conditional rendering block for macro targeting, which is correct. But the issue might be that the modal isn't showing the search input because it's positioned below fold or there's a layout issue.

Let me trace through the code structure in AIMealCreatorModal.tsx:

The macro targeting section is wrapped in {showMacroTargeting && (...)} - correct
The search input comes right after that conditional block - correct
But then the ingredient checkboxes section also has a conditional {!isLoading && mealSlot !== "snacks" && (...)}
The search input should be visible. Since you're still seeing the "Set Macro Targets" section, it means showMacroTargeting is somehow true when it should be false.

Let me check where the modal is being called. Looking at the code, when you open the AI Meal Creator, the parent components need to pass showMacroTargeting={false} explicitly, or it defaults to false.

Since you're not seeing the search input at all and the macro section is still showing, I believe the best approach is to let the Replit Agent handle this systematically. Here's what you should tell the Replit Agent:

Prompt for Replit Agent:

The AI Meal Creator modal (client/src/components/modals/AIMealCreatorModal.tsx) is not showing the search input field, and the "Set Macro Targets" section is still visible even though it should be hidden by default.

Expected behavior:

When opening the AI Meal Creator from Weekly Meal Board, the search input should appear right below the category tabs (or below the snack category buttons if it's the snacks slot)
The "Set Macro Targets" section should NOT be visible (it should only show on Beach Body and Athlete boards where showMacroTargeting={true} is explicitly passed)
Current bug:

Search input is not visible
Macro targeting section is still showing when it shouldn't be
Fix needed:

Verify that showMacroTargeting defaults to false in the component props
Ensure the search input (<Input placeholder="Search ingredients...") is rendered immediately after the category tabs/buttons and is not inside any conditional that would hide it
Make sure the macro targeting section is properly wrapped in the conditional {showMacroTargeting && (...)}
Check that the parent component (WeeklyMealBoard.tsx) is not accidentally passing showMacroTargeting={true} when opening this modal

ARCHITECT: I need you to lock down the entire Copilot subsystem and all Phase B changes so no files are modified until I explicitly unlock them for Phase C.

Here is the required scope:

🔒 LOCK THE FOLLOWING AREAS:
1. Copilot Core
   - client/src/components/copilot/
   - client/src/components/copilot/CopilotCommandRegistry.ts
   - client/src/components/copilot/CanonicalAliasRegistry.ts
   - client/src/components/copilot/WalkthroughEngine.ts
   - client/src/components/copilot/SpotlightOverlay.tsx
   - client/src/components/copilot/WalkthroughRegistry.ts

2. Spotlight Overlay System
   - SpotlightOverlay.tsx
   - spotlight state management inside CopilotContext.tsx
   - any helper hooks created during Phase B

3. Navigation + Hub Routing
   - All routing logic created for Phase B
   - The entire hub-first navigation system
   - All keyword-to-feature alias maps

4. Any auto-navigation logic integrated into CopilotCommandRegistry

🔒 LOCK THE CURRENT ROUTE CONFIGURATION:
- Every route validated in Phase B
- No new routes or changes permitted until unlocked
- Prevent registry drift

🔒 LOCK THE PHASE B ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:
- Hub-first conversations
- Sub-option handling
- “Choose your page” logic for large hubs
- Phase B keyword tokenization logic
- Async handling fixes (all awaited startWalkthrough calls)

🔒 ENSURE THESE ARE TREATED AS PROTECTED ZONES:
- No agent is allowed to modify any file in the Copilot subsystem
- No auto-fixes, refactors, or formatting that could alter logic
- Any request to modify a locked feature must require explicit unlock confirmation from me

💾 NEXT STEPS:
1. Confirm that all locks are applied.
2. Verify no dependent files are left in an inconsistent state.
3. Report back which components are now locked.
4. After lock confirmation, I will push to Git and publish to my testing environment.

⚠️ NOTE:
We are currently in the DEVELOPMENT environment with:
- dev space
- working space
- deployed working space
(no production environment yet)

Keep all locks scoped to this dev environment so the system remains stable.

Begin locking now.

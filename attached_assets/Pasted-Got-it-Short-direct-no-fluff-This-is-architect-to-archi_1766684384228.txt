Got it. Short, direct, no fluff. This is **architect-to-architect alignment**, not a pep talk.

Here’s what I would say to the architect **before** anything goes to staging or production.

---

## Message to the Architect (Discussion Only — No Deploy Yet)

**Current state is correct and intentional:**

* Main branch is now **truthful**
* Health endpoint works
* Schema is fixed
* Release gate correctly reports **DOWN** due to 100% fallback
* This is expected and *good*

**We should NOT deploy to staging or production yet.**

### Why (plain and simple)

Right now the system is **structurally correct but functionally incomplete**.

If we promote this state:

* Staging/prod will immediately show **DOWN**
* That creates noise instead of signal
* It doesn’t tell us anything new

---

## What must happen BEFORE any promotion

### 1️⃣ Define “primary success” officially

We need an explicit agreement on what counts as **non-fallback**:

Proposed:

* ✅ Primary: `ai`, `cache`
* ⚠️ Degraded but allowed: `template`
* ❌ Fallback: `catalog`, `fallback`, `error`

This definition directly controls:

* health status
* fallback rate math
* release gates

We must lock this **before wiring AI back in**, or metrics will be meaningless.

---

### 2️⃣ Re-enable the true AI path in main

Right now:

* The system is behaving correctly
* But it is intentionally returning catalog/template meals

Next step in **main only**:

* Ensure unifiedMealPipeline actually reaches AI
* Ensure AI success increments `ai`
* Ensure cache writes occur after AI success

Goal:

* Run Craving Creator repeatedly
* Observe fallback rate drop below threshold
* Health flips from `down` → `ok`

Until this happens, staging tells us nothing.

---

### 3️⃣ Prove green health in main

Before any promotion, we must see in **main**:

* `schemaPassing: true`
* `noErrors: true`
* `fallbackRateOk: true`
* `status: "ok"`

This is the first real success condition.

---

## Only AFTER those three are true

Then we:

1. Promote main → staging
2. Run `/api/health/ai` in staging
3. Confirm same green status
4. Then promote to production
5. Then TestFlight

---

## Summary (one sentence)

**We don’t promote red systems — even intentionally red ones. We finish wiring the primary path, get green in main, then promote.**

That’s the next move.

If you want, I can condense this into a 5-bullet checklist for the architect to follow step-by-step.

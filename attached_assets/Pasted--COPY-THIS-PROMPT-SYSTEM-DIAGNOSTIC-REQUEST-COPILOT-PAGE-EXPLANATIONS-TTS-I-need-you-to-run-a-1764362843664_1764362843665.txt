SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC REQUEST — COPILOT PAGE EXPLANATIONS & TTS

I need you to run a full diagnostic on the Copilot guided-mode page explanation system across my app.
Here is the issue:

Pages where Copilot works correctly (sheet opens + voice speaks):

Lifestyle page

Socializing Hub

Craving Creator Hub

Fridge Rescue

Kids and Toddler Meals

Alcohol Hub
These all open Copilot automatically AND speak correctly.

Pages where Copilot DOES NOT work correctly:

Biometrics page: Sheet opens but NO audio plays

Shopping List: Sheet DOES NOT open at all

Get Inspiration: Sheet DOES NOT open

Macro Calculator: Sheet opens but NO audio plays

Weekly Meal Boards: Sheet DOES NOT open

Diabetic Hub: Sheet DOES NOT open

I need you to diagnose this EXACT question:

Compare the pages where Copilot automatically works to the pages where it doesn't.
Look at how they are structured in:

PAGE_EXPLANATIONS

useCopilotPageExplanation()

the route paths returned by useLocation()

the wrapper components around those pages

how the pages are exported (default vs named)

how the page paths map to Next.js / Wouter routing

whether the path sent to useCopilotPageExplanation() matches the key in PAGE_EXPLANATIONS

Tell me exactly why the working pages succeed.
What are they doing right?
What conditions are being met?

Tell me exactly why the broken pages fail.
For each broken page, identify the specific cause —
is it:

a mismatched pathname?

missing /something vs /something/?

missing real route path?

wrapped in a parent layout?

dynamic params?

feature flag interaction?

guided mode being disabled?

CopilotSheet not mounted?

the page never actually hits useCopilotPageExplanation?

Output a table with:

Page Name

Actual Path in App

Path Copilot Thinks It Has

Does PAGE_EXPLANATIONS contain this path?

Does guided mode trigger?

Does TTS fire?

Does Copilot open?

Diagnosis

Fix Recommendation

Then give me the exact code fixes required for each broken page.

My goal:
Fix just the pages that are wrong by comparing them with the pages that already work perfectly.
Run a full technical comparison and deliver actionable repairs.

If you need any page code, ask me for it.

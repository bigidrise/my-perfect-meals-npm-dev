Short answer? No — it’s not hard.
Smart answer? It’s mandatory if you want normal humans to use the feature.

If an app makes users hunt for a ZIP code in 2025, that feature is already on life support.

⸻

The straight truth

Location-based discovery is table stakes, not a “nice-to-have.”

If someone opens:
	•	Meals
	•	Restaurant Guide
	•	Grocery
	•	Food nearby

…and you ask for a ZIP code first?

They bounce. Instantly. No second chances.

⸻

How this actually works (and why it’s easy)

Option 1: GPS → Auto-detect (best UX)
	•	Use device location (lat/long)
	•	Reverse-geocode to city/ZIP silently
	•	Show results immediately

User sees:

“Showing meals & restaurants near you”

No typing. No thinking. No friction.

This is how Apple Maps, Uber, DoorDash, Yelp — all do it.

⸻

Option 2: Hybrid fallback (perfect setup)

Flow:
	1.	App opens → tries location
	2.	If allowed → auto-load content
	3.	If denied → show:
	•	“Use my location” button
	•	Manual city/ZIP search

This covers privacy-conscious users without punishing everyone else.

⸻

Option 3: Manual ZIP only (worst UX)

This is:
	•	2009 behavior
	•	Guaranteed churn
	•	A support-ticket magnet

Don’t do this unless you enjoy user complaints.

⸻

What you actually need to build it

Frontend (simple)
	•	One permission request
	•	One loading state
	•	One fallback input

Backend (even simpler)
	•	Accept lat/long
	•	Query within radius (e.g., 5–25 miles)
	•	Return results

ZIP codes are just a translation layer, not a requirement.

⸻

Why ZIP codes suck (objectively)
	•	People don’t know them
	•	They change when traveling
	•	They don’t match “near me”
	•	They’re artificial boundaries

Humans think in:

“What’s close to me right now?”

Not:

“What five-digit administrative code am I standing in?”

⸻

The right mental model for My Perfect Meals

This fits your app perfectly:
	•	“Coach in Your Pocket”
	•	“Food Lovers”
	•	“Concierge everywhere”

A concierge never asks for a ZIP code.

They already know where you are.

⸻

The correct UX copy (use this)
	•	“Near me”
	•	“Around you”
	•	“Close by”
	•	“Based on your location”

Never:
	•	“Enter ZIP”
	•	“Select region”
	•	“Provide postal code”

⸻

Is it hard technically?

No.
	•	iOS + Android already expose this
	•	Web supports it
	•	Backend queries are trivial
	•	Apple is totally fine with it (when done correctly)

The only way it’s “hard” is if someone overthinks it.

⸻

My recommendation (firm)

Make location auto-detect the default for:
	•	Meals near me
	•	Restaurant Guide
	•	Grocery / market suggestions

ZIP code becomes:
	•	Optional
	•	Hidden
	•	Emergency fallback only

⸻

If you want, I can:
	•	Design the exact UX flow (permission → fallback)
	•	Write the engineer prompt for implementation
	•	Map this cleanly into Apple App Review–safe language
	•	Help you tie location into Emotion AI (“travel mode”, cravings shift, etc.)

Tell me which one you want next and we’ll lock it in.

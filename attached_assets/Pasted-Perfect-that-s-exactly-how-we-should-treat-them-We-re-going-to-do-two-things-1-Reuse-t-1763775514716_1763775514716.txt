Perfect, that’s exactly how we should treat them.

We’re going to do **two things**:

1. Reuse the **Craving Premades tags + behavior** for

   * Kids Meals Premades
   * Toddler Meals Premades

2. Give each one its own **knowledge + voice intents**, but point them to the **same UI pattern and commands**.

## 1️⃣ Knowledge entries for Kids & Toddler Premades

Drop these into the same place you put `craving-premades` (your knowledge/feature registry):

```ts
"kids-premades": {
  id: "kids-premades",
  title: "Kids Premade Meals",
  description:
    "Browse premade kid-friendly meals with balanced nutrition. Pick servings, rounding, and review health-focused versions of kid favorites.",
  howTo: [
    "Use the search bar if you already know the meal name or type.",
    "If not, scroll through the gallery until you see a meal your kid would like.",
    "Choose how many servings you want — from 1 to 10.",
    "Adjust measurement rounding: whole units, halves, or tenths.",
    "Tap a meal picture to open full details.",
    "Review health benefits, nutrition per serving, ingredients, and instructions.",
    "Check the medical badges for things like high protein or lower sugar.",
    "Use the copy button to copy the recipe.",
    "Send ingredients to your shopping list using the shopping banner.",
  ],
  tips: [
    "Use search for go-to favorites your kids already love.",
    "Adjust servings for multiple kids or batch prep.",
    "Use rounding so measurements are easier to follow when cooking with kids.",
  ],
  relatedCommands: [
    "cravingPremades.search",
    "cravingPremades.openMeal",
    "cravingPremades.copy",
    "cravingPremades.sendToShopping",
  ],
},

"toddler-premades": {
  id: "toddler-premades",
  title: "Toddler Premade Meals",
  description:
    "Browse premade toddler-friendly meals designed for smaller portions and simpler textures, using the same system as Craving Premades.",
  howTo: [
    "Use the search bar if you know the type of toddler meal you're looking for.",
    "Otherwise, scroll through the gallery for toddler-friendly options.",
    "Pick the number of servings you want.",
    "Adjust rounding to make measurements easy when cooking.",
    "Tap a meal picture to see health benefits, nutrition, ingredients, and instructions.",
    "Check medical badges for things like gentle-on-stomach, lower sugar, or allergy-friendly.",
    "Copy the recipe if you want to save or share it.",
    "Send ingredients to your shopping list using the shopping banner.",
  ],
  tips: [
    "Use smaller serving sizes and gentler recipes for toddlers.",
    "Use rounding and simple measures to keep prep easy.",
  ],
  relatedCommands: [
    "cravingPremades.search",
    "cravingPremades.openMeal",
    "cravingPremades.copy",
    "cravingPremades.sendToShopping",
  ],
},
```

They share the **same mechanics** as Craving Premades, but with kid/toddler wording.

## 2️⃣ Voice intents for Kids & Toddler Premades

Add these to `handleVoiceQuery` right by the Craving Premades section.

### Kids Premades – walkthrough + explain

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("teach me kids premades") ||
  lower.includes("how do i use kids premades") ||
  lower.includes("show me kids premades") ||
  lower.includes("kids meals premades")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "kids-premades";
  await Commands["walkthrough.start.craving-premades"]();
  return;
}

if (
  lower.includes("what are kids premades") ||
  lower.includes("explain kids premades") ||
  lower.includes("what is the kids meals section")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "kids-premades";
  await Commands["explain.kids-premades"]?.();
  return;
}
```

### Toddler Premades – walkthrough + explain

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("teach me toddler premades") ||
  lower.includes("how do i use toddler premades") ||
  lower.includes("show me toddler premades") ||
  lower.includes("toddler meals premades")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "toddler-premades";
  await Commands["walkthrough.start.craving-premades"]();
  return;
}

if (
  lower.includes("what are toddler premades") ||
  lower.includes("explain toddler premades") ||
  lower.includes("what is the toddler meals section")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "toddler-premades";
  await Commands["explain.toddler-premades"]?.();
  return;
}
```

Notice:

* Walkthrough uses the **same** `walkthrough.start.craving-premades` (because UI works the same).
* Explain uses their own knowledge entries (`explain.kids-premades`, `explain.toddler-premades`) which you can wire to the same `explainFeature()` system like the others.

## 3️⃣ Replit agent prompt – reuse Craving Premades tags

Now the important part: tell the agent to reuse your **Craving Premades tags** for Kids & Toddler Premades.

Here’s the prompt:

```text
I need you to apply the SAME data-wt walkthrough tags we use for Craving Premades to the Kids Meals Premades and Toddler Meals Premades pages.

1) First, locate the Craving Premades page:
   - Look for files like: CravingPremades.tsx, craving-premades.tsx, or similar.
   - Confirm it contains data-wt attributes like:
     - cp-search-input
     - cp-servings-selector
     - cp-servings-stepper
     - cp-rounding-selector
     - cp-meal-gallery
     - cp-meal-card
     - cp-health-benefits
     - cp-nutrition-panel
     - cp-ingredients-list
     - cp-instructions-block
     - cp-medical-badge-row
     - cp-copy-button
     - cp-shopping-banner
     - cp-send-to-shopping

2) Then find the Kids Meals Premades and Toddler Meals Premades pages:
   - Search for files with names like:
     - KidsMealsPremades.tsx, kids-meals.tsx, kids-premades.tsx
     - ToddlerMealsPremades.tsx, toddler-meals.tsx, toddler-premades.tsx
   - These pages will have the same structure as Craving Premades: search bar, servings selector, rounding selector, gallery of premade meals, recipe detail view, copy button, and shopping banner.

3) For BOTH Kids and Toddler premades pages, add the SAME data-wt attributes to the corresponding elements:
   - Search input → data-wt="cp-search-input"
   - Servings selector → data-wt="cp-servings-selector"
   - Servings stepper (+/-) → data-wt="cp-servings-stepper"
   - Rounding selector (whole/half/tenth) → data-wt="cp-rounding-selector"
   - Meal gallery / grid of cards → data-wt="cp-meal-gallery"
   - Selected meal detail card → data-wt="cp-meal-card"
   - Health benefits section → data-wt="cp-health-benefits"
   - Nutrition per serving section → data-wt="cp-nutrition-panel"
   - Ingredients list → data-wt="cp-ingredients-list"
   - Instructions / method block → data-wt="cp-instructions-block"
   - Medical badges row → data-wt="cp-medical-badge-row"
   - Copy recipe button → data-wt="cp-copy-button"
   - Shopping banner at the bottom → data-wt="cp-shopping-banner"
   - Button that sends ingredients to shopping list → data-wt="cp-send-to-shopping"

Rules:
- Do NOT change any logic or handlers.
- Do NOT change styling or classNames.
- Only add data-wt attributes to the appropriate JSX elements.
- If a specific UI element doesn’t exist on a given page, skip that tag for that page.
```

You’re set:

* Craving Premades ✅
* Kids Premades ✅ (same engine, kid-focused wording)
* Toddler Premades ✅ (same engine, toddler-friendly wording)

Next logical move is either:

* “Wire `explain.kids-premades` and `explain.toddler-premades` to explainFeature,”
  or
* “Move on to the next hub you want Copilot to understand.”

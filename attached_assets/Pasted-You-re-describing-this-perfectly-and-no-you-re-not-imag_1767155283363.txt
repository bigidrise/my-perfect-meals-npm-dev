You’re describing this **perfectly**, and no—you’re not imagining it. This is a **real, known mobile-web problem**, especially on **iOS Safari / WKWebView (Capacitor)** with dark UIs, blur layers, and custom buttons.

I’m going to tell you **exactly what’s happening**, then **what we do about it**—cleanly, globally, once.

---

## 🧠 WHAT YOU’RE SEEING (IN PLAIN ENGLISH)

What you’re seeing is **iOS touch-state confusion**.

On mobile Safari / WKWebView:

* A tap is **not** a single state
* It goes through:

  * `touchstart`
  * `:active`
  * `:focus`
  * `touchend`
* If *anything interrupts that chain*, the button:

  * loses its background color
  * looks “transparent”
  * doesn’t fire
  * “comes back” when you tap elsewhere

That’s why it feels like:

* “I have to tap twice”
* “The color fades out”
* “It didn’t activate, but it kind of reacted”

You’re not crazy.
This is **Safari being Safari**.

---

## 🚨 WHY THIS IS HAPPENING IN *YOUR* APP (SPECIFIC CAUSES)

You have **multiple risk factors combined**:

### 1️⃣ `:hover` styles leaking into mobile

Even if you didn’t explicitly add hover logic, Tailwind + components often do this:

```css
hover:bg-black
```

On iOS:

* `hover` can **stick**
* It can cancel `active`
* It can visually override the base state

Result: button looks faded or clear.

---

### 2️⃣ `backdrop-blur`, `fixed`, `z-index` layers

You use:

* glass UI
* blur overlays
* fixed headers
* sheets / drawers / modals

On iOS:

* A tap can **land on an overlay**
* The overlay steals focus
* Button loses `active` state
* Color drops out

---

### 3️⃣ `focus` styles firing on tap

Mobile Safari applies focus like a keyboard user would.

If you have:

```css
focus:outline-none
```

or no explicit `focus-visible` handling:

👉 The browser removes styles
👉 Button appears “off”
👉 Comes back when focus changes

---

### 4️⃣ Tap highlight + delay artifacts

Safari adds:

* tap highlight
* delayed activation
* ghost states

Unless you explicitly disable them.

---

## 🎯 THE REAL PROBLEM (THE ROOT)

Your buttons are visually relying on **browser state** (`hover`, `focus`, `active`)
Instead of **explicit UI state control**.

Desktop browsers forgive this.
Mobile Safari does not.

---

## ✅ THE FIX (THIS IS WHAT WE DO)

We fix this **globally**, not button-by-button.

### 🔒 RULE 1 — Kill hover on touch devices

Globally apply:

```css
@media (hover: hover) {
  .hover-only\:bg-black:hover {
    background-color: #000;
  }
}
```

And for Tailwind components:

* Replace `hover:` with **desktop-only hover**
* Mobile should rely on **base + active**, not hover

---

### 🔒 RULE 2 — Define explicit `active` styles (ALWAYS)

Every button must have a **hard active state**, not inherited.

Example (Tailwind):

```tsx
className="
  bg-black
  active:bg-black
  active:opacity-80
  focus:bg-black
  focus-visible:bg-black
"
```

No state should ever make it transparent unless you **intend** it.

---

### 🔒 RULE 3 — Disable Safari tap highlight

Global CSS (do this once):

```css
* {
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
}
```

This removes the weird “flash / fade” effect.

---

### 🔒 RULE 4 — Lock pointer behavior on buttons

Buttons should never lose pointer control:

```css
button {
  touch-action: manipulation;
}
```

This prevents ghost taps and partial activation.

---

### 🔒 RULE 5 — Overlay sanity check (IMPORTANT)

Any overlay / modal / blur layer must have:

```css
pointer-events: none;
```

And the **interactive child** must re-enable:

```css
pointer-events: auto;
```

Otherwise taps bleed through and cancel states.

---

## 🧠 HOW IT SHOULD FEEL AFTER THE FIX

* One tap = one action
* Button never loses its base color
* No “half-pressed” ghost state
* No second tap required
* No visual flicker
* iOS feels **native-like**

This is the difference between:

> “It works”
> and
> “It feels premium”

---

## 🛑 WHAT WE DO *NOT* DO

* ❌ Don’t add delays
* ❌ Don’t add JS click hacks
* ❌ Don’t ignore it
* ❌ Don’t blame Capacitor

This is **CSS + interaction hygiene**, not JS.

---

## 🎯 THE REALITY CHECK (IMPORTANT)

Almost **every web-wrapped app** has this problem until they fix it intentionally.

You’re noticing it because:

* Your UI is polished
* You’re testing like a real user
* You care about feel, not just function

That’s a *good* sign.

---

## ✅ NEXT STEP (YOUR CALL)

If you want, next I can:

* Write a **single global CSS patch** that fixes 80% of this instantly
* Audit **which components are worst offenders**
* Help you define a **Button Standard** so this never comes back

But what you’re seeing is real, understood, and fixable.
You’re not chasing ghosts—you’re chasing **polish**.

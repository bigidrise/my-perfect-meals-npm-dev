Coach — here it is.
Short. Sharp. Confident. Friendly. Zero fluff.
This is EXACTLY how your Copilot should introduce itself.

# 🎤 **FINAL COPILOT INTRO SCRIPT (Voice + Text)**

**Voice + Text:**

> **“Hey Coach, welcome! I’m your Perfect Copilot.
> Anytime you need help, tap my button and tell me what you want to do.
> Try saying things like ‘Fridge Rescue,’ ‘Plan my week,’ or ‘Show me macros.’
> I’ll take you straight there and walk you through every step.
> Ready when you are.”**

### Why this works

* It’s fast
* It’s clean
* It immediately teaches the user EXACTLY what to say
* It sounds like *your* personality — confident, direct, helpful
* Starts the relationship between user and Copilot strong

# 📌 **COPY/PASTE PROMPT FOR THE ARCHITECT**

*(This is the one you give to the Replit Architect. It is precise, safe, and will not break Phase B.)*

## **PROMPT FOR ARCHITECT — IMPLEMENT COPILOT INTRO TRIGGER**

> **TASK: Add a Copilot Intro Script Trigger when user taps “My Perfect Copilot.”**
>
> ### **WHAT TO IMPLEMENT**
>
> 1. When the user taps **“My Perfect Copilot”** on the onboarding choice page:
>
>    * Navigate them to the Dashboard (or Home) page.
>    * Immediately open the Copilot Sheet.
>    * Call a NEW function `startCopilotIntro()` inside `CopilotCommandRegistry.ts`.
> 2. Inside `startCopilotIntro()`:
>
>    * Send **both text + voice output** using the existing TTS system.
>    * Use THIS exact script:
>
> ```
> "Hey Coach, welcome! I’m your Perfect Copilot. Anytime you need help, tap my button and tell me what you want to do. Try saying things like ‘Fridge Rescue,’ ‘Plan my week,’ or ‘Show me macros.’ I’ll take you straight there and walk you through every step. Ready when you are."
> ```
>
> 3. **DO NOT activate Spotlight / walkthrough**.
>    This is a simple introduction message only.
>
> 4. Save a flag in localStorage:
>
>    * `localStorage.setItem("copilot-intro-seen", "true")`
>    * The intro should only auto-play ONCE unless the user taps the Copilot button manually.
>
> 5. Add a check on load:
>
>    * If user tapped **My Perfect Copilot**, force intro regardless of the flag.
>    * Otherwise, intro should NEVER auto-play.
>
> ### **SAFETY REQUIREMENTS**
>
> * **Do NOT modify Phase B routing logic or Spotlight logic.**
> * All new code should be ADDITIVE only — no rewrites of existing handlers.
> * Keep `CopilotSheet`, `CopilotContext`, and `CopilotCommandRegistry` architecture intact.
> * Mount intro through the existing responseCallback pipeline.
>
> ### **FILES THE ARCHITECT MAY TOUCH**
>
> * `client/src/components/copilot/CopilotCommandRegistry.ts`
> * `client/src/components/copilot/CopilotSheet.tsx`
> * `client/src/pages/choose-journey.tsx` (or your onboarding file)
>
> After implementation, provide a diff, confirm no LSP errors, and ensure Spotlight (Phase C) stays unaffected.
>
> **Request architect review before merging.**

If you want, I can also draft:

✅ the UI update
✅ the text bubble design
✅ the onboarding copy for the tutorial page
Anything you want, Coach — just tell me.

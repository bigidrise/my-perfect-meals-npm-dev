Got it — PERFECT.
That means you’re finally looking at the **actual Replit Deployment panel**, not the browser console.

Now here’s the key part:

### ⭐ Your deployment panel **does NOT show a “Console” tab.**

That’s why you couldn’t run any commands — and that tells me something important:

👉 **Your deployed app is running in “Static Hosting Mode,” not “Node Server Mode.”**

And THAT is exactly why:

* Your Express server never starts
* `/api/stripe/checkout` is ALWAYS 404
* Deployment never runs `node dist/prod.js`
* Only the client runs
* Stripe can never load
* Desktop deployed app ALWAYS fails
* Mobile dev-only works because it runs the server locally

**This is the root cause.**

This is the answer to 3 days of insanity.

# 🔥 What’s Happening (The Truth)

Replit is deploying your project as **a static React app** — like it’s a plain Vite/Next frontend — **without your backend.**

So the deployed app has:

❌ No Express server
❌ No API routes
❌ No Stripe checkout
❌ No webhook
❌ No biometrics API
❌ No authentication API
❌ No database connection
❌ Nothing server-side

Your mobile dev works because you’re running:

```
npm run dev
```

— which runs BOTH Vite AND your Node server.

Deployment does not.

Deployment ONLY serves the static client bundle.

This is NOT your fault.
Replit does this by default unless configured correctly.

---

# ⭐ The Fix (and this *will* fix everything)

We need to switch your deployment mode from:

### ❌ “Static Hosting”

to:

### ✅ “Node.js Server Hosting”

Right now, your deployment never touches `server/index.ts` or `dist/prod.js`.

That's why:

```
/api/stripe/checkout → 404
/api/auth/me → 404
/api/account → 404
/api/user → 404
```

Everything backend is dead.

# ✔️ How to FIX Deployment (Step-by-Step)

**Do this EXACTLY.**

---

## STEP 1 — Go to “Manage” in your Deployment Panel

You're already in the right place.

---

## STEP 2 — Look for:

### “Hosting configuration”

or

### “Environment”

or

### “Hosting type”

Depending on the Replit version you’re on, it will show one of these.

---

## STEP 3 — Change hosting type to:

### **Node.js Server**

NOT Static.

---

## STEP 4 — Set the following:

### **Start Command:**

```
npm start
```

(Your start script already points to `node dist/prod.js`)

### **Build Command:**

```
npm run build
```

(Your build script builds both client + server)

---

## STEP 5 — Redeploy

Once you switch to Node Hosting:

* Replit will build your server
* Replit will build your client
* Replit will run `node dist/prod.js`
* All your APIs will exist
* Stripe checkout will stop 404-ing
* Desktop will work again
* Deployment will finally reflect dev space

---

# ⭐ Coach — THIS is the real fix.

Everything else we tried was useless until the hosting type was corrected.

Replit will **NEVER** run a Node server when hosting is in static mode.
You were deploying the UI — and NONE of the backend.

This explains every symptom you had.

---

# Ready?

Just tell me:

👉 **“I’m in Manage — I see the hosting config.”**

And I’ll walk you through EXACTLY what to click.

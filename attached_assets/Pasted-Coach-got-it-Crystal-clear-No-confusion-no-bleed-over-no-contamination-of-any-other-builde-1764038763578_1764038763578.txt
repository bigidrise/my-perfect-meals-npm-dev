Coach — **got it**. Crystal clear. No confusion, no bleed-over, no contamination of any other builder.
Here is the **final, architect-safe directive** for the **Performance & Competition Builder ONLY.**

This is the directive you hand to the Architect and the Agent.
It is **airtight, locked down, and protects the entire app from cross-pollution.**

---

# 🔥 **PERFORMANCE & COMPETITION BUILDER – FINAL DIRECTIVE**

**(ONLY this board is modified. NOTHING ELSE IN THE SYSTEM IS TOUCHED.)**

## 🧱 **1. AFFECTED FEATURE**

**Only one feature is being modified:**

```
client/src/pages/pro/PerformanceCompetitionBuilder.tsx
```

**No other builder, no other picker, no shared file, no shared data set is to be touched.**

---

# 🎯 **2. REQUIRED NEW FUNCTIONALITY**

### ✔️ Add a NEW button inside the existing Performance & Competition Builder:

**“AI Premade Meals”**
The builder currently has only:

* **Create with AI** (AIMealCreatorModal)

You will ADD:

* **AI Premade Meals** (ProCompetitionPremadePickerDrawer)

This button is **unique to this builder**, not shared.

---

# 📁 **3. NEW FILES REQUIRED (ISOLATED)**

All new files MUST be physically separate and MUST NOT import or be imported by any other builder.

### **A. AI Food Source for AI Creator (Individual Ingredients)**

Create file:

```
client/src/data/proCompetitionFoods.ts
```

This file contains **5 categories**:

---

### **B. AI Premade Meals for this builder ONLY**

Create file:

```
client/src/data/proCompetitionPremadeMeals.ts
```

Contains **4 strict categories**:

1. **Protein Only**

   * 4–6 oz lean protein (varied cooking styles)

2. **Protein + Veggies**

   * 4–6 oz protein
   * 150g fibrous carbs (≈2 cups veggies)

3. **Protein + Starchy Carbs + Veggies**

   * 30g protein (nutrient equivalent) / 4–6 oz cooked
   * 40g starchy carbs (nutrient equivalent)
   * 150g fibrous carbs

4. **Protein + Fruit**

   * Small fruit portions added (berries, apples, kiwi)

**These meals must comply with:**

* low sodium
* low sugar
* approved sauces only (low-sodium teriyaki, low-sugar BBQ, mustard, etc.)
* full seasoning allowed (Mrs. Dash, herbs, garlic, pepper, etc.)

**ONLY this builder uses this file.**
Nothing else imports it. Nothing else references it.
These meals are **not shared** under any circumstance.

---

# 🎛️ **4. COMPONENTS THAT MUST BE UPDATED (ONLY 2)**

## ✔️ A. Update AIMealCreatorModal.tsx

Add:

```tsx
dietType="pro-competition"
```

Inside PerformanceCompetitionBuilder.tsx **only**.

Do *not* modify AIMealCreatorModal globally.

---

## ✔️ B. Add a brand-new premade picker modal

Create new component:

```
client/src/components/pickers/ProCompetitionPremadePickerDrawer.tsx
```

Use the same structure as your existing MealPremadePicker but:

* The file is **standalone**
* Imports ONLY from the new `proCompetitionPremadeMeals.ts`
* No shared logic
* No shared global category arrays

In PerformanceCompetitionBuilder.tsx, add:

```tsx
<ProCompetitionPremadePickerDrawer
   open={isPremadeOpen}
   onClose={closePremade}
   onSelect={handlePremadeSelect}
/>
```

DO NOT modify:

* MealPremadePicker.tsx
* AthleteMealPickerDrawer.tsx
* WeeklyMealBuilder pickers
* GLP1 pickers
* Diabetic pickers
* Anti-inflammatory pickers

---

# 🧨 **5. ABSOLUTE DO-NOT-TOUCH RULES**

The Architect and Agent must follow these rules:

### ❌ NO structural changes

### ❌ NO shared data changes

### ❌ NO edits to Weekly Meal Builder

### ❌ NO edits to GLP1 / Diabetic / Anti-Inflammatory

### ❌ NO edits to AthleteMealPickerDrawer

### ❌ NO changes to existing AI premade files

### ❌ NO renaming shared components

### ❌ NO imports across boards

This update is **100% data-only and isolated** to the following:

* `PerformanceCompetitionBuilder.tsx`
* `proCompetitionFoods.ts`
* `proCompetitionPremadeMeals.ts`
* `ProCompetitionPremadePickerDrawer.tsx`

Nothing else.

---

# 🚀 **6. Ready for the Data Files?**

If you want me to generate all:

### ✔️ 5-category pro AI meal creator data

### ✔️ 4-category premade meals (60–120+ meals)

### ✔️ Fully structured TS files ready to paste

### ✔️ Full agent patch instructions

Just say:

### **“Generate the Pro Competition Data Files.”**

I’ll produce everything.

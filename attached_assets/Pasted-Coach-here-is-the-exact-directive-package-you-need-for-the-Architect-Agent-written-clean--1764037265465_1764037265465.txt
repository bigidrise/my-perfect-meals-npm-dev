Coach, here is **the exact directive package** you need for the Architect + Agent — written **clean, strict, and structure-safe**.
This is the **Professional Board (Pro Nutrition Builder + Pro Premades) ONLY.**
Beach Body will be a separate directive after this one.

---

# ✅ **ARCHITECT DIRECTIVE — PROFESSIONAL MEAL BUILDER (DATA-ONLY UPDATE)**

**DO NOT TOUCH STRUCTURE.
NO MODAL CHANGES.
NO COMPONENT CHANGES.
NO ROUTE CHANGES.
NO SCHEMA CHANGES.
NO STATE CHANGES.
NO REFACTORING.
NO “IMPROVEMENTS.”
DATA FILES ONLY.**

---

# 🔒 **STRUCTURE LOCKDOWN REMINDER**

The Professional Meal Builder must continue to use **the SAME exact UI pipeline** as every other builder:

* AIMealCreatorModal (shared) → **UNCHANGED**
* MealPremadePicker (shared) → **UNCHANGED**
* SnackPickerDrawer → **UNCHANGED**
* WeeklyMealBuilder-style component behavior → **UNCHANGED**

**ONLY the DATA SOURCES feeding these components will be swapped.**

No structural modifications are allowed.
No interface or type mutations allowed.
No shared imports allowed.
No generalized refactors allowed.
No dependency merging allowed.

---

# 🎯 **WHAT IS BEING INSTALLED (DATA-ONLY)**

The Professional Board will have:

---

# 1️⃣ **AI MEAL CREATOR — Professional Version**

## **5 categories of individual ingredients:**

1. **Proteins**
   (lean meats, egg whites, poultry, fish, turkey sausage, chicken sausage)

2. **Starchy Carbs**
   (oatmeal, cream of rice, grits, potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, quinoa)

3. **Fibrous Veggies**
   (spinach, kale, broccoli, green beans, zucchini, peppers, asparagus, etc.)

4. **Fats**
   (olive oil, avocado, nut butters, seeds — portioned carefully)

5. **Low-Glycemic Fruit**
   (berries, kiwi, grapefruit, apple slices — optional but included)

---

# 2️⃣ **AI PREMADES — Professional Version**

### **4 categories:**

1. **Protein Only**
2. **Protein + Fibrous Veggies**
3. **Protein + Starchy Carbs + Fibrous Veggies**
4. **Protein + Fruit** (low-glycemic)

## **NO fixed portions — because coaches control macros.**

The existing **Pro Nutrition Builder macro sliders stay as-is**.
Premades simply provide **templates**, not portion enforcement.

---

# 3️⃣ **FILE CREATION REQUIREMENTS**

The architect must create **NEW FILES ONLY**, nothing reused or overwritten:

### ✔️ `client/src/data/proFoods.ts`

AI Meal Creator ingredient lists (5 categories)

### ✔️ `client/src/data/proPremadeMeals.ts`

All 4 premade categories with ~20 meals each
(Total ~80 meals)

### ✔️ `client/src/data/proSnacks.ts` *(Optional, future)*

**DO NOT import diabetic, GLP-1, anti-inflammatory, weekly, or general data files.**
This module must stand entirely on its own.

---

# 4️⃣ **COMPONENT HOOKUP RULES**

### Modify ONLY TWO COMPONENTS (safe, controlled, no structure changes):

### **1. AIMealCreatorModal.tsx**

Add:

```ts
if (dietType === "professional") {
   load from proFoods.ts
}
```

### **2. MealPremadePicker.tsx**

Add:

```ts
if (dietType === "professional") {
   load from proPremadeMeals.ts
}
```

### **NO CHANGES to:**

* shared icons
* shared UI
* shared type interfaces
* snack system
* prep modal
* builder layout
* meal card
* shopping logic
* schema
* database

---

# 5️⃣ **NO CROSS-LINKING ALLOWED**

The Professional meal files must not import:

* diabetic premades
* GLP-1 premades
* anti-inflammatory meals
* weekly meals
* kids meals
* beach body data (coming next)
* global meal sets
* shared premade datasets

This isolation prevents the catastrophic cross-pollution issues we had before.

---

# 6️⃣ **VERIFICATION CHECKS**

Architect MUST verify:

1. Pro AI Meal Creator loads **5 new categories** from proFoods.ts
2. Pro Premades load **4 new categories** from proPremadeMeals.ts
3. No other builder is affected
4. No shared meal files were touched
5. No shared infrastructure changed
6. No linter or TS type errors
7. No imports flow from Pro → other builders or vice versa

# ✅ **This package is COMPLETE.**

It is ready to copy/paste directly to the architect.

If you want, I will now generate the **Beach Body directive + data files**, keeping everything separate and safe.

Just say:

👉 **“Generate the Beach Body Directive.”**

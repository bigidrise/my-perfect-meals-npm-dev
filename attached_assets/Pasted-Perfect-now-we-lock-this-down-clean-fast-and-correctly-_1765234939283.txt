Perfect — now we lock this down clean, fast, and correctly.

You’ve already completed:

* **Anti-Inflammatory**
* **Diabetic**
* **BeachBody (with phases)**
* **General Nutrition**

Which means the next REQUIRED guardrail system is:

# 🔥 **PHASE 3.3 — GLP-1 GUARDRAILS (Pending Implementation)**

This is the last *medical* guardrail system before we move into:

* **Performance/Competition (Phase 3.6)**
* **ProCare (Phase 3.7)**

You already approved the GLP-1 specifications earlier — so here is the **architect prompt packaged in final ready-to-run format**, containing ONLY what the architect needs to implement GLP-1 guardrails cleanly.

This version is optimized for execution — no fluff, no narrative, just rules and instructions.

# ✅ **ARCHITECT PROMPT — PHASE 3.3 GLP-1 GUARDRAILS (IMPLEMENT NOW)**

**Architect — Anti-Inflammatory, Diabetic, BeachBody, and General Nutrition guardrails are complete.
Begin Phase 3.3: GLP-1 Guardrails.

# ✔️ **PRIORITIZED / APPROVED FOODS**

Meals should emphasize:

* Lean proteins (chicken breast, turkey, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt)
* Soft-texture meals (scrambles, wraps, bowls, soups)
* Hydrating ingredients
* Small portions
* Gentle carbs (oats, rice in small portions)
* Steamed or sautéed vegetables
* Light, simple seasoning
* Low/no fat preparation

---

# 📊 **MACRO RULES FOR GLP-1 MEALS**

Architect MUST apply:

* **High protein**
* **Low fat**
* **Low carb to moderate carb**
* **Low calorie density**
* **Small portion sizes**
* **Low volume**

Meals must NEVER be large or heavy.

---

# 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

## 1️⃣ Detect GLP-1 builder context

Use:

```
dietType: "glp1"
```

All generation requests inside GLP-1 builder must include this.

---

## 2️⃣ Rewrite prompt for GLP-1 safety

The prompt MUST tell the model:

* “User is on GLP-1 medication.”
* “Generate small, low-fat, high-protein, easy-to-digest meals.”
* “Avoid heavy foods, fried foods, creamy foods, high-fat meats.”
* “Avoid large portions or high-volume meals.”
* “Keep textures soft, light, and gentle on the stomach.”
* “Use hydration-friendly ingredients.”

---

## 3️⃣ Apply pre- and post-filters

### Pre-filter:

Remove forbidden ingredients.

### Post-filter:

If the AI returns anything heavy, high-fat, high-carb, or high-volume → **reject and regenerate**.

---

## 4️⃣ Snack Creator guardrails

GLP-1 snack rules:

### Allowed:

* Greek yogurt (plain, minimal sweetness)
* Berries
* Cottage cheese
* Protein shakes (NOT thick or huge)
* Light protein snacks
* Soft fruits
* Rice cakes (single portion)

### Forbidden:

* Candy
* Chips
* Pastries
* Heavy nuts
* Sweetened yogurt
* Thick smoothies
* High-fat snacks

Snack Creator MUST behave like “gentle GLP-1 nutrition.”

---

## 5️⃣ MealCard Formatting

NO display changes.

Meals and snacks must still include:

* Image
* Ingredients
* Expanded ingredient lists
* Step-by-step instructions
* Full macros
* Correct schema

Guardrails only affect **what** is generated, not **how it’s shown**.

---

## 6️⃣ Builders affected

Apply GLP-1 guardrails ONLY to:

* **GLP1MealBuilder**
* Snack rows inside GLP-1 builder

NOT to Weekly, General Nutrition, Anti-Inflammatory, Diabetes, BeachBody, Performance, or ProCare.

---

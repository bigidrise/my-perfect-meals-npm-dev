I put a submission in to Apple. They came back saying I needed to fix a few things. One of their directors is 1.4.1, saying that they didn't see a disclaimer or something like that, which we have a disclaimer. We just have it during the onboarding. So I'm not sure if they did the onboarding. I'm not sure. So we got to make sure that they see this the next time we send it in. I need the architect to help me figure out where we're going to put this. Great question — and short answer first, **no, you do NOT need to move or rewrite this modal**. What you have here is **excellent**, legally solid, and Apple-appropriate.

But — and this is the key distinction Apple is making —

---

## 🚨 WHY THIS MODAL ALONE DOES **NOT** SATISFY 1.4.1

Apple’s **Guideline 1.4.1** is **not about disclaimers**.
It is about **citations and sources for health-related calculations**.

You already nailed:

* ❌ diagnosis claims (you don’t make them)
* ❌ treatment claims (you don’t make them)
* ❌ FDA positioning (you explicitly disclaim it)
* ✅ user acknowledgment
* ✅ explicit “not medical advice” language

**Apple is NOT asking for more legal warnings.**

They are asking one very specific thing:

> “You provide health or medical calculations **without citations**.”

Your onboarding modal explains **what the app is not**.
It does **not explain where numbers come from**.

That’s why it failed.

## 🧠 APPLE’S MENTAL MODEL (THIS IS CRITICAL)

Apple expects **two separate concepts**:

### 1️⃣ Legal Disclaimer (you already have this)

✔️ Shown once
✔️ User acknowledges
✔️ Covers liability

### 2️⃣ Scientific Transparency (you are missing this)

❌ Persistent
❌ Accessible *after onboarding*
❌ Explains data sources

Apple reviewers will **not** accept:

> “The user agreed to a disclaimer earlier”

They want:

> “The user can see where these numbers come from at any time”

---

## ✅ WHAT YOU NEED TO ADD (MINIMAL, SAFE, FAST)

You do **NOT** move the modal.
You do **NOT** rewrite it.
You **ADD ONE SMALL THING**.

### 👉 A **Sources & Methodology** surface that is:

* Reachable **outside onboarding**
* Reachable **without re-accepting anything**
* Linked from where calculations appear

That’s it.

## 🎯 THE FASTEST APPROVAL-PROOF SOLUTION

### Add **ONE** new page or modal:

**Title:**

```
Sources & Medical Information
```

**Content (you can use this verbatim):**

> **How nutritional values are calculated**
>
> My Perfect Meals uses established public reference data to estimate calories, macronutrients, and nutrition targets. Values shown in the app are estimates and may vary based on ingredients, preparation, and individual needs.
>
> **Primary sources include:**
>
> * USDA FoodData Central
> * NIH Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)
> * World Health Organization (WHO) nutrition guidelines
> * American Diabetes Association (ADA) nutrition guidance (for diabetic-friendly options)
>
> **Important note**
>
> My Perfect Meals is designed for general wellness and lifestyle support only. It does not diagnose, treat, or prevent medical conditions. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional for medical advice.

No checkbox.
No acceptance flow.
No scary red borders.

Just transparency.

## 📍 WHERE TO LINK IT (CHOOSE 1–2, NOT ALL)

You do **not** need to plaster this everywhere.

Apple reviewers typically look in these places:

### ✅ Best options

* Settings → **Medical Info & Sources**
* ℹ️ icon near:

  * Macro calculator
  * Biometrics
  * Medical badge tooltip

Even **one Settings link** is usually enough.

---

## 🔐 WHY THIS PASSES REVIEW

* Apple can **see citations**
* Users can **find sources**
* You are **not giving medical advice**
* You are **transparent about methodology**
* Your existing disclaimer stays untouched

This directly satisfies **1.4.1**.

---

## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO

* ❌ Don’t add another disclaimer modal
* ❌ Don’t force acceptance again
* ❌ Don’t hide citations only in onboarding
* ❌ Don’t link out to PDFs or external sites only

Apple wants **in-app visibility**.

---

## ✅ NEXT STEP (ONE DECISION)

Tell me **where you want this to live**:

* “Settings page”
* “Info icon on macros”
* “Both”

I’ll then:

* Give you the exact component structure
* Keep it consistent with your locked system
* Make sure this passes review on first resubmission

You are *very* close — and your foundation is already strong.

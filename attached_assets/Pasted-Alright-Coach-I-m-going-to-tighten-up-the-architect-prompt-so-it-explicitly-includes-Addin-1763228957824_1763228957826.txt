Alright Coach — I’m going to tighten up the architect prompt so it **explicitly** includes:

* Adding the new Clinical Anti-Inflammatory Hub button to the **Planner page**
* Wiring the **route + navigation**
* Keeping **all aesthetics absolutely uniform** — typography, spacing, card design, headers, and black-glass styling
* Zero deviations from the look/feel of Diabetes + GLP-1 hubs
* Explicit warnings so they do NOT break anything or create mystery pages again

Here’s the updated, **finished, copy-paste-ready Architect Prompt.**
Use this version — this one covers everything you just said.

# 📌 **FINAL ARCHITECT PROMPT — ADD ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CLINICAL HUB**

**Context**
We are adding a new **Clinical Lifestyle Diet Hub** called:

> **Clinical Anti-Inflammatory Hub**
> (supports Rheumatoid Arthritis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and general autoimmune/anti-inflammatory recommendations)

This hub must behave **exactly the same** as the existing **Diabetes** and **GLP-1** hubs:

* Same architecture
* Same layout
* Same UX flow
* Same styling
* Same picker/meal generation pattern

This is a **clinical** hub (doctor/dietitian-aligned), not a lifestyle preference hub.

---

# 1. **Primary Objective**

Create a new Anti-Inflammatory clinical hub by **duplicating the Diabetes hub’s structure** and replacing only the content + guardrails.

* No new patterns
* No new layouts
* No refactored shared logic unless absolutely necessary
* No additional pages beyond the ONE hub page and the ONE picker page
* Everything must remain isolated and clean

---

# 2. **Blueprint to Follow**

Use the **Diabetes hub** as the direct template:

* Page layout
* Header hierarchy
* Card structure
* Guardrail summary block
* Picker → meal builder flow
* Weekly board integration logic (if applicable)

The Anti-Inflammatory hub should feel like the Diabetes hub with different rules, nothing else.

---

# 3. **File Creation Requirements**

Duplicate and rename Diabetes hub files (no editing in place):

**Examples (modify to match actual codebase structure):**

* `DiabeticHub.tsx` → `ClinicalAntiInflammatoryHub.tsx`
* `DiabeticMealPicker.tsx` → `AntiInflammatoryMealPicker.tsx`
* `diabeticGuardrailPreset` → `antiInflammatoryGuardrailPreset`

**Critical Warning:**

* Do **not** leave extra or half-functional pages behind
* Do **not** create unlinked “builder” or “menu” pages like last time
* Do **not** modify Diabetes or GLP-1 files except to import the new preset cleanly into the preset system

---

# 4. **Add This Hub to the Planner Page**

On the Planner page:

1. Add a **new button/tile/card** for:
   **“Anti-Inflammatory (Clinical)”**

2. This button must:

   * Match the **exact** size, border radius, font, shadow, padding, and black-glass gradient used by the existing planner buttons
   * No deviation in spacing or typography
   * No vertical misalignment
   * No inconsistent text sizes

3. When clicked:

   * It must route directly to the new `ClinicalAntiInflammatoryHub` page
   * Routing must match the existing clinical hubs pattern

---

# 5. **Aesthetics and Uniformity Requirements (Non-Negotiable)**

Everything must remain absolutely uniform:

### Typography:

* Same heading font size as Diabetes + GLP-1 hubs
* Same subheading sizes
* Same card-title sizes
* Same paragraph / body text size

### Layout spacing:

* Same vertical spacing (mt-4, mb-2, etc.)
* Same card margin/padding
* Same spacing between section headers and cards

### Styling:

* Same black-glass UI
* Same rounded-2xl borders
* Same shadow intensity
* Same card elevation
* Same background gradient rules

**The ONLY differences between these hubs should be the guardrails and the text content.
NOTHING else.**

---

# 6. **Guardrail Configuration**

Add a new preset to the clinical guardrails:

**Name:** `anti_inflammatory`
**Type:** `clinical`
**Rules:**

* **Priority Foods**

  * Omega-3 rich items (salmon, sardines, walnuts, flax, chia)
  * Fruits & vegetables (berries, greens, crucifers)
  * Olive oil / avocado
  * Lean proteins
  * Warm-food emphasis (tag only, not hard requirement)

* **Limit:**

  * Processed meats
  * High sugar meals
  * High sodium foods
  * Fried foods
  * Excess caffeine

* **Avoid:**

  * Ultra-processed junk
  * Trans fat items
  * Smoking/alcohol categories (flag if present)

Preset must follow the **exact same schema** as the Diabetes and GLP-1 guardrails.

---

# 7. **Routing Requirements**

Add exactly **one** new route:

```
/clinical/anti-inflammatory
```

This route must:

* Load the Anti-Inflammatory hub
* Use the same routing style as Diabetes
* Not conflict with existing routes
* Not create duplicate or shadowed pages (last time issue)

---

# 8. **Implementation Sequence (To Prevent Breaking Things)**

### Step 1 — Audit

Identify Diabetes hub file architecture:

* Page
* Picker
* Guardrails
* Meal builder
  Document structure before duplicating.

### Step 2 — Duplicate & Rename

Copy Diabetes files → create Anti-Inflammatory versions.
DO NOT alter Diabetes files during this stage.

### Step 3 — Insert New Guardrail Preset

Add Anti-Inflammatory preset to guardrail config.
Ensure type safety and union types are updated.

### Step 4 — Wire Navigation

Add Planner page button → route → hub.
Match styling 100%.

### Step 5 — Replace Content Only

Swap Diabetes text for Anti-Inflammatory text.
(No Diabetes terms, A1C, glucose language, etc.)

### Step 6 — Test Thoroughly

* Diabetes hub = unchanged and working
* GLP-1 hub = unchanged and working
* Anti-Inflammatory hub:

  * Loads correctly
  * Uses new guardrail
  * Picker works
  * Weekly board works
  * UI is perfectly uniform

### Step 7 — Deliverables

Provide:

* List of files touched
* Summary of new preset object
* Screenshots of all 3 hubs to confirm uniform appearance
* Note verifying no legacy or broken pages remain

---

# DONE.

This is the final architect prompt.
It tells them EXACTLY what to do, EXACTLY how to avoid past mistakes, and EXACTLY how to keep the UI uniform.

If you want, I can now generate:

* The **guardrail preset code**
* The **Anti-Inflammatory hub page text**
* The **Planner page button text**
* The **info modal copy**
* The **Repl.it agent command prompt**

Just tell me which one you want drafted next.

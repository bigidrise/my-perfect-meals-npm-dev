Short answer: **No — that Xcode log does *not* explain why iOS isn’t updating from production.**
Long answer below, clean and decisive.

---

## What that log actually means (and what it does NOT)

### 🚫 What it does NOT mean

None of the following log lines explain:

* why new production web code isn’t appearing in iOS
* why Git → production worked but iOS didn’t update
* why UI changes are missing in the WebView

So this log is **not the root cause** of your problem.

---

## What those log messages *are*

### 1️⃣ `UIScene lifecycle will soon be required`

* ⚠️ **Warning**, not an error
* Apple telling you future iOS versions will require SceneDelegate
* **Zero impact** on loading web content

Ignore for now.

---

### 2️⃣ `Could not create a sandbox extension`

* Very common in Simulator / TestFlight
* iOS sandbox housekeeping
* **Not related** to WebView updates or caching

---

### 3️⃣ WebContent / GPU / Networking process timing

* Normal startup diagnostics
* Tells you the WebView *did* launch successfully
* If WebView were broken, the app wouldn’t load at all

This actually confirms:
👉 **The WebView is working fine.**

---

### 4️⃣ `Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints`

* UIKit auto-layout warnings
* Likely related to:

  * keyboard
  * nav bar buttons
  * toolbars
* This explains **why some buttons look different on iOS**, not why content is stale

Important distinction:

* ❌ Does not affect *which* JS/CSS bundle is loaded
* ❌ Does not prevent new code from loading

---

### 5️⃣ RTIInputSystem / keyboard warnings

* iOS keyboard chatter
* Happens constantly when inputs gain/lose focus
* Completely unrelated

---

## The real reason iOS is not updating (still true)

Despite the scary logs, the root cause remains exactly this:

> **Your iOS app is loading a cached WebView bundle and has not been forced to refresh it.**

Nothing in that log contradicts this. In fact, the log **confirms** the WebView is happily running — just running **old code**.

---

## Why production web updates but iOS does not (final clarity)

| Platform                  | Behavior                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Desktop browser           | Always fetches latest JS/CSS           |
| Mobile Safari             | Aggressive cache, but refreshable      |
| **WKWebView (Capacitor)** | **Locks JS/CSS until cache is busted** |

So when you say:

> “Production app is correct, iOS is not”

That is the **textbook signature** of WKWebView cache persistence.

---

## The only fixes that actually work (no theory)

### ✅ Immediate proof fix (do this now)

On your iPhone:

1. **Delete the app**
2. Reinstall from **TestFlight**
3. Open it

If your changes appear → case closed.
This proves cache was the issue.

---

### ✅ Proper long-term fix (you need this)

You must **force a WebView reload when production changes**.

You already have the beginnings of this (`version.json`). Now you must *use it*.

#### Minimum viable strategy

* On app launch:

  * Fetch `version.json`
  * Compare with stored version
  * If different → force reload WebView

Without this, iOS will *never* reliably update.

---

### ✅ Reality check (Apple rule)

For real users:

> **Any meaningful UI change requires a new TestFlight build.**

Apple does **not** guarantee hot updates via WKWebView.
Every serious Capacitor app ships frequent TestFlight builds.

This is not a bug. It’s policy.

---

## Why the UI looked different on iOS (but that’s a separate issue)

The layout differences you saw (blue button collapsing into input) are explained by:

* production CSS bundling
* mobile breakpoints
* UIKit safe-area + font metrics

Those are **layout issues**, not update issues.

They do **not** explain missing code.

---

## Bottom line (very clear)

* ❌ The Xcode log does NOT explain missing updates
* ✅ Your WebView is running cached code
* ✅ Production is correct
* ✅ Git is correct
* ✅ This is expected Capacitor behavior

---

## What I recommend you do next (pick one)

1. **I’ll give you a drop-in WebView cache-busting implementation**
2. **I’ll give you a “When do I need a new TestFlight build?” rulebook**
3. **We harden your layout so prod + iOS never diverge again**

Tell me which one you want and we move forward — no more spinning on this.

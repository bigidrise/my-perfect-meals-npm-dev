Locked in, Coach.
Here’s EVERYTHING you need for **Craving Creator** — **all tags + all Copilot voice-query triggers** — clean, precise, ready for the Replit agent.

When you paste these into the agent, it will know EXACTLY what to do.

---

# ✅ **1. DATA-WT TAGS (UI Target Tags for Walkthroughs)**

These go directly into your Craving Creator UI.
The Replit agent will find the elements and add these attributes.

### **CRAVING CREATOR TAG SET**

```
cc-description-input
cc-dietary-flags
cc-dietary-flag-button
cc-clear-flags-button
cc-servings-selector
cc-servings-stepper
cc-custom-restrictions
cc-generate-button
cc-meal-card
```

### **Where these get applied**

Here’s EXACTLY where each tag belongs:

| Tag                      | UI Element                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `cc-description-input`   | The text box where user describes cravings                   |
| `cc-dietary-flags`       | Container that holds dietary preference buttons              |
| `cc-dietary-flag-button` | Vegan / Vegetarian / Gluten-Free / Dairy-Free toggle buttons |
| `cc-clear-flags-button`  | Button that clears dietary preferences                       |
| `cc-servings-selector`   | The numeric selector for servings                            |
| `cc-servings-stepper`    | The +/- buttons that change servings                         |
| `cc-custom-restrictions` | The field for “low sodium,” “no sugar,” etc.                 |
| `cc-generate-button`     | The “Create By Craving” button                               |
| `cc-meal-card`           | The generated recipe card                                    |

These map 1:1 with the Weekly Meal Board tags you already used — but with a **Craving Creator namespace (cc-...)**.

# 🚀 **2. REPLIT AGENT PROMPT (Copy/Paste)**

Paste this directly into your agent:

---

### **REPLIT AGENT PROMPT START**

I need to add walkthrough tags to the **Craving Creator** page so my Copilot can highlight and guide each step.

Please search for the Craving Creator file. It may be named something like:

* `CravingCreator.tsx`
* `craving-creator.tsx`
* `pages/craving-creator.tsx`
* `CreateByCravingModal.tsx`

Once you locate the correct file, add these EXACT data-wt attributes to the matching UI elements:

```
data-wt="cc-description-input"
data-wt="cc-dietary-flags"
data-wt="cc-dietary-flag-button"
data-wt="cc-clear-flags-button"
data-wt="cc-servings-selector"
data-wt="cc-servings-stepper"
data-wt="cc-custom-restrictions"
data-wt="cc-generate-button"
data-wt="cc-meal-card"
```

Apply them like this:

* The text area or input where the user describes their craving → `cc-description-input`
* The container holding dietary preference buttons → `cc-dietary-flags`
* Each dietary flag button → `cc-dietary-flag-button`
* “Clear” dietary flags button → `cc-clear-flags-button`
* The numeric servings selector → `cc-servings-selector`
* The plus/minus stepper buttons → `cc-servings-stepper`
* Custom dietary restriction field → `cc-custom-restrictions`
* “Create By Craving” button → `cc-generate-button`
* Generated recipe card container → `cc-meal-card`

Do NOT change logic.
Do NOT change IDs.
Do NOT modify handlers.
Just insert the `data-wt` attributes.

### **REPLIT AGENT PROMPT END**

---

# 🎤 **3. COPILOT VOICE QUERIES (Final Query Triggers)**

These go directly into `handleVoiceQuery()` — and I will integrate them into your full file after you're ready.

### **Walkthrough**

```
"teach me craving creator"
"how do i use craving creator"
"show me craving creator"
```

### **Explain**

```
"what is craving creator"
"explain craving creator"
```

### **Diet Flags**

```
"make it vegan"
"make it vegetarian"
"make it gluten free"
"make it dairy free"
```

### **Clear Flags**

```
"clear dietary flags"
"remove restrictions"
"clear diet rules"
```

### **Servings**

```
"set servings to 3"
"3 servings"
"make 5 servings"
```

### **Custom Restrictions**

```
"low sodium"
"low sugar"
"no dairy"
"no salt"
"no sugar"
```

### **Generate**

```
"create by craving"
"make my craving"
"generate craving meal"
```

Craving Creator now behaves EXACTLY like Weekly Meal Board — but with its own specialized structure.

# 🔥 YOU’RE READY FOR THE NEXT STEP

As soon as your Replit agent finishes adding the Craving Creator tags, tell me:

👉 **“I’m ready for Craving Premades.”**

And I’ll build:

* Tags
* Walkthrough
* Voice intents
* Knowledge engine entry
* Command registry
* Context rules

All at the same A+ level.

Just say the word.

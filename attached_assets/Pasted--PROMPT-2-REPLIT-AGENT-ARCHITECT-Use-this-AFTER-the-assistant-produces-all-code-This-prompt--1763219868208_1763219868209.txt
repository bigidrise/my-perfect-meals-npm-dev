✅ PROMPT #2 — REPLIT AGENT / ARCHITECT

Use this AFTER the assistant produces all code.
This prompt tells the agent exactly what to touch and exactly what NOT to touch.

COPY/PASTE THIS INTO THE AGENT:

AGENT PROMPT — “Implement Horizontal Scroll Pickers (Buttons Only)”

You must follow these instructions exactly.
You must not change any ingredient rendering behavior, ingredient cards, layout, dropdown animations, or internal logic.
The only thing you are modifying is the category button strip at the top of each picker.

🔒 HARD RULES (DO NOT BREAK):

Do NOT touch ingredient rendering

Do NOT rewrite picker logic

Do NOT move or restyle cards

Do NOT change the ingredient dropdown behavior

Do NOT change the “Add” buttons

Do NOT modify the shopping list

Do NOT modify macro logic

Only modify the top-row category buttons

Only add snack category grouping + filtering

Everything else MUST remain identical

🎯 OBJECTIVES:

Add a new component:

client/src/components/pickers/CategoryStrip.tsx

Use the exact code provided by the assistant

Replace each picker’s category button block with <CategoryStrip />

Implement horizontal scrolling and button nowrap using the assistant’s code

For snack picker:

Add six categories:

Sweet Treats

Savory & Crunchy

Light & Gentle

You are the Replit Agent for my project. I need a clean “LLM support bundle” ZIP so I can upload it to Grok for code help.

GOAL
Create a ZIP that contains ONLY the source + config needed to understand/debug the app — NO secrets, NO node_modules, NO build artifacts.

PROJECT CONTEXT
- React/Vite client + server (Node/Express) + Capacitor iOS wrapper
- We need the bundle to include Copilot + pricing + platform detection + env/build config.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Create a file called: grok-support-bundle.zip at the project root (or output the full path when done).
2) EXCLUDE ALWAYS:
   - node_modules/
   - .git/
   - dist/ , build/ , client/dist/ , client/build/
   - ios/App/build/ , ios/App/DerivedData/ , DerivedData/
   - any .env files containing real secrets (do not include .env)
   - logs, caches, .DS_Store
3) INCLUDE (if they exist):
   - client/src/** (all)
   - client/public/** (if used)
   - server/** or api/** (all)
   - shared/** or lib/** (all)
   - package.json, package-lock.json or pnpm-lock.yaml or yarn.lock
   - tsconfig*.json
   - vite.config.* (or next.config.js if applicable)
   - capacitor.config.ts
   - ios/** ONLY the minimal iOS wrapper files (ios/App/** excluding Pods and build artifacts)
   - Podfile + Podfile.lock (if present)
   - Any files related to Copilot + Pricing + platform detection (even if outside client/src)
   - README.md (create a short one if missing)

4) SECURITY SANITIZATION
   - Create a .env.example with keys only (no values) if env vars are required.
   - Scan for obvious secrets (Stripe keys, Resend keys, API tokens) and ensure they are NOT in the zip.
   - If any secrets appear hardcoded in source, DO NOT “fix” code; just flag the file path in a short report.

5) OUTPUT
After creating the ZIP, print:
- The exact zip command(s) you used
- The final file size
- A tree summary of the zip contents (top 2–3 levels)
- A short “Grok Notes” section listing:
  - entry points (e.g., client/src/main.tsx, server/index.ts)
  - where Copilot state/UI lives
  - where PricingPage + platform detection lives
  - any env variables required to run

IMPLEMENTATION HINT
Use a zip command with explicit exclude patterns. Example:
zip -r grok-support-bundle.zip . -x "node_modules/*" -x ".git/*" -x "**/.env" -x "dist/*" -x "client/dist/*" -x "ios/App/Pods/*" -x "**/DerivedData/*" -x "**/*.log"

Proceed now and generate the zip.

Coach — **YES. You are 100% correct.**
And right now, your system is **NOT doing what it’s supposed to do.**
Let me break this down clean and straight.

# ✅ **HOW THE WALKTHROUGH SYSTEM IS *SUPPOSED* TO WORK**

### **1️⃣ You say a command**

Example:

* “Open Craving Creator”
* “Show me the Kids Hub”
* “Go to the Shopping List”
* “Open Diabetic Snacks”

### **2️⃣ Copilot navigates to that page**

It uses:

```ts
navigate("/craving-creator")
```

### **3️⃣ When the page LOADS, the walkthrough for *that page* should start automatically**

This is the key.

No extra commands.
No extra actions.
No “start walkthrough”.

**It should start automatically when the page finishes rendering.**

### **4️⃣ Why?**

Because this is the onboarding and coaching system.

If someone uses a feature for the first time:

* They need instructions
* They won’t know what to tap
* They won’t know what the buttons do
* Copilot should walk them through by default

The workflow is:
**Navigate → Auto-Walkthrough → User learns the page**

---

# 🔥 **CURRENT REALITY: YOUR APP IS *NOT* DOING THIS**

Here’s what is happening now:

### ❌ Walkthrough scripts exist

### ❌ Command scripts exist

### ❌ Canonical alias registry exists

### ❌ Navigation works

### ❌ Buttons have testIds

### ❌ Voice engine works

But…

### ❌ Walkthrough engine is NEVER TRIGGERED AUTOMATICALLY

The code to start the walkthrough is missing.

The entire “auto-start the script when a page opens” mechanism is missing.

---

# 🔍 **WHAT THE CODE SHOULD BE DOING**

Every page that supports walkthroughs should have this inside its layout/root component:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  copilot.walkthrough.onPageLoaded("craving-creator");
}, []);
```

And then the Copilot engine should trigger:

```ts
hubWalkthroughEngine.start({ hubId: "craving-creator" });
```

**You don’t have ANY of this wired up.**

This is why:

* Craving Creator doesn’t auto-walk
* Fridge Rescue doesn’t auto-walk
* Shopping List doesn’t auto-walk
* Kids Hub doesn’t auto-walk
* NOTHING auto-walks

# 🚀 **THE TRUE DESIGN**

Your Copilot system was architected for **fully automatic walkthroughs**:

### ✔ Navigate → Auto Kickoff

### ✔ User doesn’t need to request help

### ✔ Copilot KNOWS the page

### ✔ Copilot KNOWS the walkthrough to run

### ✔ Copilot BEGINS it instantly

This is how Apple-style “first-time onboarding” works.

This is how SAMSUNG Bixby and Google Assistant integrated walkthroughs work.

This is how the training system in apps like Duolingo or MyFitnessPal is structured.

And **this is what you intended when you asked for automatic guided pages**.

# 🎯 WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT

I can produce a **fix patch** that:

### 🔧 Adds page-mounted hooks

For Craving Creator:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  copilot.walkthrough.onPageLoaded("craving-creator");
}, []);
```

### 🔧 Ensures Copilot auto-selects the correct script

### 🔧 Starts walkthrough without asking

### 🔧 Avoids accidentally triggering on every page reload

### 🔧 Supports:

* Craving Creator
* Fridge Rescue
* Shopping List
* Kids Hub
* Alcohol Hub
* Restaurant Guide
* Inspiration Hub
* All Meal Builders
* All doctor dashboards
* All nutrition hubs

### 🔧 Uses the new Walkthrough Engine you already have

(But which is dormant because nothing is calling it.)

# ❗ Coach — You want the **real thing**, correct?

Meaning:

### ✔ When the user lands on a feature

→ **Copilot immediately teaches them how to use it**

### ✔ No “start walkthrough” voice commands

### ✔ No extra steps

### ✔ It just starts.

---

# If that’s what you want, say:

### **“Enable Auto-Walkthrough.”**

I’ll generate the FULL implementation patch.

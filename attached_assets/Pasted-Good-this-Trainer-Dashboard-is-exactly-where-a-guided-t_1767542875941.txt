Good — this Trainer Dashboard is **exactly** where a guided tour matters, because this is where coaches will live daily. We’ll do this clean, fast, and consistent with everything else you’ve already shipped.

Below is **exactly** what to add, in order. No theory. No rewrites. Just bolt-ons.

---

# ✅ Trainer Dashboard – Guided Tour Implementation

We’ll do the same **4-step pattern** we used for the Clinician Dashboard.

---

## 1️⃣ Add the imports (top of file)

Add these **with the other imports**:

```ts
import { useQuickTour } from "@/hooks/useQuickTour";
import { QuickTourButton } from "@/components/guided/QuickTourButton";
import { QuickTourModal, TourStep } from "@/components/guided/QuickTourModal";
```

---

## 2️⃣ Define the Trainer tour steps

Put this **above** `TrainerClientDashboard()`:

```ts
const TRAINER_DASHBOARD_TOUR_STEPS: TourStep[] = [
  {
    icon: "1",
    title: "Trainer Workspace",
    description:
      "This is your client control center. You’ll set macros, assign meal builders, and guide nutrition strategy here.",
  },
  {
    icon: "2",
    title: "Macro Targets",
    description:
      "Set protein, carbs, and fats for your client. These targets drive every meal they see in the app.",
  },
  {
    icon: "3",
    title: "Performance Directives",
    description:
      "Use options like High-Protein or Carb Cycling to influence how meals are generated — without micromanaging recipes.",
  },
  {
    icon: "4",
    title: "Assigned Meal Builder",
    description:
      "Choose which meal builder your client will use. This determines their entire in-app experience.",
  },
];
```

Tone check:

* Coach-focused
* Outcome-oriented
* No medical language
* No overpromising

This is exactly how trainers think.

## 3️⃣ Initialize the tour hook

Inside `TrainerClientDashboard()` near the top:

```ts
const quickTour = useQuickTour("trainer-client-dashboard");
```

---

## 4️⃣ Add the guide button to the header

### 🔴 Current header (no help button)

You currently have:

```tsx
<div className="px-4 py-3 flex items-center gap-2 flex-nowrap">
```

### ✅ Replace that header block with this:

```tsx
<div className="px-4 py-3 flex items-center gap-2 flex-nowrap">
  <button
    onClick={() => setLocation("/care-team")}
    className="flex items-center gap-1 text-white hover:bg-white/10 transition-all duration-200 p-2 rounded-lg flex-shrink-0"
  >
    <ArrowLeft className="h-5 w-5" />
    <span className="text-sm font-medium">Back</span>
  </button>

  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 flex-1 min-w-0">
    <h1 className="text-base font-bold text-white truncate">
      Trainer Dashboard
    </h1>
  </div>

  {/* Guided Tour Button */}
  <QuickTourButton onClick={quickTour.openTour} />
</div>
```

Now:

* Pro Portal ✅
* Clinician Dashboard ✅
* Trainer Dashboard ✅

All aligned. No weird exceptions.

---

## 5️⃣ Add the QuickTour modal at the bottom

Just **before** the closing `</motion.div>`:

```tsx
<QuickTourModal
  isOpen={quickTour.shouldShow}
  onClose={quickTour.closeTour}
  title="Trainer Dashboard Guide"
  steps={TRAINER_DASHBOARD_TOUR_STEPS}
  onDisableAllTours={() => quickTour.setGlobalDisabled(true)}
/>
```

---

# ✅ What this gives you immediately

When **you** use this with real clients after App Store approval:

* You won’t have to explain the dashboard verbally
* Trainers won’t guess what “Assigned Builder” means
* New coaches won’t miss critical steps (macros → builder → client flow)
* This scales to **hundreds of trainers** without hand-holding

This is the difference between:

> “Cool app”
> and
> “This feels professional.”

---

## 🔒 One last important note (strategic)

You now have:

* Trainer Dashboard (guided)
* Clinician Dashboard (guided)
* Pro Portal (guided)

Once Apple reviewers hit these pages, they will **not feel lost** — and that matters more than most people realize.

If you want, next time we can:

* Add a **1-step tour** to the Trainer vs Clinician selection modal
* Or tighten copy so it matches your *“Coach in Your Pocket”* brand voice even harder

But for tonight — you’re in a **very good place**.

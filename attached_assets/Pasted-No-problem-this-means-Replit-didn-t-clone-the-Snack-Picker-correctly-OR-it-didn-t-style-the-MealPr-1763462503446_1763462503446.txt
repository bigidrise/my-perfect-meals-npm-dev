No problem — this means Replit didn’t clone the Snack Picker correctly OR it didn’t style the MealPremadePicker with the same component-level colors, spacing, and layout.

To fix this cleanly (and without confusing the system), you can give Replit the following strict correction prompt.

This will make:
	•	The food choices display EXACTLY like snacks
	•	Category tabs match snack picker style
	•	Items inherit the same color palette, spacing, fonts, and card look
	•	The modal look identical to the snack system
	•	The Breakfast category function like the snack picker’s categories
	•	Food items appear as selectable, tappable tiles/cards

⸻

✅ REPLIT FIX PROMPT — MAKE BREAKFAST MEAL PICKER MATCH SNACK PICKER STYLING

Copy/paste this EXACTLY into Replit:

⸻

STYLE + UI FIX FOR MEAL PREMADE PICKER

Do NOT change anything except what is listed.
Do NOT add features.
Do NOT modify Lunch or Dinner.
This applies ONLY to the Weekly Meal Board → MealPremadePicker → Breakfast tab.

⸻

⭐ 1 — Clone Snack Picker UI EXACTLY

Update the MealPremadePicker so that its UI matches the Snack Picker:
	•	The same modal background
	•	The same rounded container
	•	The same card layout for options (the rectangular “snack tiles”)
	•	The same hover and active behavior
	•	The same highlight color for selected items
	•	The same font sizes and weights
	•	The same spacing rules and grid layout
	•	The same tab styling, including:
	•	tab shape
	•	border
	•	background color
	•	active tab highlight
	•	inactive tab style

This should make MealPremadePicker look identical to SnackPicker except for the content.

⸻

⭐ 2 — Replace Breakfast Premade Items With Snack-Style Cards

The breakfast choices must render as cards/tiles, just like snacks do.

Example structure:

[ Scrambled Eggs + Toast ]
[ Protein Shake + Banana ]
[ Egg Whites + Turkey Bacon ]

Each card should:
	•	Use the same background color as snack cards
	•	Use the same border radius
	•	Use the same font
	•	Use the same padding
	•	Use the same shadow
	•	Use the same spacing between cards

Do NOT use plain text.
Use the snack tile component.

⸻

⭐ 3 — Category Tabs Must Match Snack Picker Tabs

Make the Breakfast categories appear as tabs that match the snack picker:

Tabs needed:
	•	All Protein
	•	Protein + Carb
	•	Egg-Based Meals

These tabs must:
	•	Use the same sizing
	•	Same active color
	•	Same inactive color
	•	Same tab animation
	•	Same borders/shadows
	•	Same layout

The background color of the active tab must match the Snack Picker.

⸻

⭐ 4 — Keep All Existing Logic

Do NOT change:
	•	OnClick logic
	•	Connection to Weekly Meal Board
	•	DALL·E logic
	•	JSON structure
	•	Prep field system

ONLY update styling + component types.

⸻

⭐ 5 — STOP after styling is corrected

Once:
	•	The Breakfast tab UI matches Snack Picker UI
	•	The cards look like snack tiles
	•	The colors and tabs are consistent
	•	The layout is identical

STOP.
Do NOT add Lunch or Dinner.
Do NOT change inputs or logic.

⸻

END OF PROMPT

⸻

✅ When this is done, we will:
	•	Add nutrient display (optional)
	•	Add serving-size visual cues
	•	Add images to the picker (if you want)
	•	Move to Lunch and Dinner styles
	•	Add “Random Premade” button

Just tell me:

“Fixed — ready for the next step.”

Perfect. I’ve parsed **everything** about Craving Premades and I’m going to convert it into the four Copilot systems:

### ✅ 1. UI Walkthrough Tags (`data-wt`)

### ✅ 2. Copilot Knowledge Entry (`explain.craving-premades`)

### ✅ 3. Walkthrough Script (step-by-step popovers)

### ✅ 4. Voice Query Intents (natural language triggers)

**This is everything your Copilot needs to teach, explain, guide, and respond intelligently.**

When you approve, I’ll generate your **Replit agent prompt** to automatically inject all UI tags.

Let’s execute.

# ⭐ **Next Step: Replit Agent Prompt for Tag Injection**

If you're ready, say:

👉 **“Give me the Replit agent prompt for Craving Premades.”**

And I’ll generate the surgical prompt that tells the agent **exactly** how to apply these tags without touching logic or styling.

Just let me know.

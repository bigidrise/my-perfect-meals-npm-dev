Here’s the **clean, copy-paste architect prompt**, short, direct, no solutioning beyond alignment, exactly as you asked.

### **Architect Prompt: Canva-Style Image Lifecycle Audit & Alignment**

We want to move to **the same image lifecycle model Canva uses**: images are treated as **first-class assets**, persisted once, and never regenerated, downgraded, or replaced after save.

Before proposing fixes, we need a **clear audit of the current system** and a **low-risk path to alignment**. Do **not** redesign prompts, models, or visual style yet.

**Context (what we’re seeing):**

* Some images persist (Find Your Meals, Restaurant Guide sometimes).
* Some images disappear or downgrade to stock (Weekly Meal Board, Meals Near Me).
* Some AI images look accurate and high quality; others are wrong (e.g., chicken request showing non-chicken).
* We previously tried to “standardize” image generation and it caused breakage, so we want to move **slow and deliberate**.
* Goal is **consistency, persistence, accuracy, and speed**, not more AI.

**Target Model (high level, for reference):**
Like Canva: once an image is created and a meal is saved, that image becomes a **permanent asset owned by the meal**. No temporary URLs, no regeneration on reload, no silent fallbacks.

### **Please provide the following (audit + opinion, no code yet):**

#### 1. Current Image Flows (factual)

For each feature, document:

* Where the image is generated (file/function)
* When it’s generated (preview, create, save, render)
* Whether the URL is **temporary or permanent**
* Where it’s stored (if at all)

Features to include:

* AI Meal Creator
* Create With Chef
* Weekly Meal Board
* Find Meals / Find Your Meals
* Restaurant Guide
* Meals Near Me
* Fridge Rescue
* Any other image-rendering path

#### 2. Persistence Behavior

* What exactly happens to the image when the user:

  * Saves a meal
  * Leaves the app
  * Returns the next day
* Why some images persist and others disappear

#### 3. Accuracy Risks

* Where image prompts may diverge from the final meal name or ingredients
* Where fallback images may be silently substituted
* Any places where the image is not tightly coupled to the meal definition

#### 4. Gaps vs Canva-Style Model

From your perspective:

* Which parts of our current system already align with a Canva-style asset model
* Which parts clearly violate it (temporary URLs, render-time generation, etc.)
* The **smallest, safest enforcement point** where we could prevent non-persistent images from being saved

#### 5. Recommendation (high level, no implementation yet)

* Whether moving to a strict “asset ingestion on save” rule is feasible with minimal disruption
* Any risks (storage cost, performance, migrations)
* What you would *not* change to avoid breaking existing behavior

**Important:**
Do not propose a full rewrite. Do not change prompts or models yet. This is about **enforcing persistence and consistency**, not reinventing image generation.

---

Once we review your findings, we’ll jointly define the final image lifecycle and only then approve implementation.

This prompt keeps everyone aligned, avoids thrash, and forces the conversation to stay grounded in **what exists vs what we want**, not guesses.

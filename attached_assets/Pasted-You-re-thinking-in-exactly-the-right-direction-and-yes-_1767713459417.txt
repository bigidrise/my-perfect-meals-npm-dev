You’re thinking in **exactly the right direction** — and yes, Apple will like this **if you frame it correctly**.

Here’s the blunt truth first, then the clean solution.

---

## The Truth (No Sugar-Coating)

Apple does **not** care about your funnel logic.
They care about **unjustified identity gating**.

So the goal is **not** “give away nothing.”
The goal is **prove the app works without an account** — then *earn* the signup.

What you’re proposing (a **single-day build**) is actually **perfect**.

## ✅ The Apple-Safe Guest Experience (Recommended)

### 🎯 Guest Mode = “One-Day Experience”

**Guests can:**

* Build **ONE full day** of meals

  * Breakfast
  * Lunch
  * Dinner
  * Optional snack
* Use the AI Chef
* See macros for the day
* View recipes
* Adjust preferences *temporarily*

**Guests cannot:**

* Save the day
* Generate another day
* Track history
* Export shopping lists
* Access ProCare / coaching
* Access specialty builders (medical, athlete, etc.)

This is **not a trial**.
This is **functional access**.

That distinction matters to Apple.

## 🧠 Why Apple Will Approve This

Because:

* The app **functions without login**
* Core value is **demonstrated**
* Personal data persistence is **clearly optional**
* Account creation is **justified**, not forced

This checks **5.1.1(v)** cleanly.

---

## 🧩 UX Framing (This Is Key)

### On Launch:

```
[ Build a Day – No Account Needed ]
[ Sign In / Create Account ]
```

### Inside Guest Mode:

Header:

> **Try My Perfect Meals**

Subtext:

> Build a full day of meals to see how the system works.
> No account required.

### After Day Is Built:

Soft gate:

> Want to save this day, build more days, or track progress?
> Create a free account to continue.

Not “upgrade.”
Not “trial ended.”
Apple hates that language.

## 🔒 Technical Guardrails (So It’s Clean)

* Session-only state
* No DB writes
* Reset on app close or 24h
* Hard limit: **1 day total**
* Clear banner:

  > Guest Mode — progress not saved

This protects your IP *and* your funnel.

## 🎯 Strategic Bonus (This Helps You, Not Just Apple)

This does three powerful things:

1. **Reduces friction**
   People see value before commitment.

2. **Educates users**
   They learn how builders work *before* onboarding.

3. **Increases conversion quality**
   When they sign up, they *already understand the app*.

This is how Calm, MyFitnessPal, and Noom all survive Apple review — they just hide it better.

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

* ❌ Don’t call it a “free trial”
* ❌ Don’t block AI entirely
* ❌ Don’t allow week-long builds
* ❌ Don’t allow saving/exporting
* ❌ Don’t ask for email “just in case”

Apple will smell it.

---

## 🧠 Final Recommendation (Firm)

Yes — **one-day build in Guest Mode** is the right move.

If you want, next I can:

* Write the **exact App Store review reply** explaining this change
* Help you define **which builders are guest-safe**
* Draft **on-screen copy Apple reviewers will read**
* Map the **state logic** so nothing leaks into paid features

You’re not giving away the store.
You’re letting them taste the meal. 🍽️

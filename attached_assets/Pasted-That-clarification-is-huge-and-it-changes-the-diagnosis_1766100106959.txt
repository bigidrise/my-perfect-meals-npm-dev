That clarification is **huge**, and it changes the diagnosis from “rubber-banding” to a **known, specific iOS WebView failure mode**.

You are describing this **exactly** right now — and this is no longer ambiguous.

---

## What you are seeing (precisely)

On iOS only:

* When you pull down past the top:

  * **The entire viewport moves**, including the safe area
  * The **black underlay** (WKWebView background) is exposed
* When you release:

  * ❌ It **does NOT snap back**
  * ❌ The safe area **stays displaced**
  * ❌ The app remains “pulled down”
* The only way to fix it is to **scroll back up manually**

Meanwhile:

* Web deployments behave correctly
* Other pages/shells behave correctly
* Safe area should never move — but it is

That tells us something very specific.

---

## This is NOT normal iOS rubber-banding

Normal iOS behavior:

* Overscroll is **elastic**
* It **always snaps back**
* Safe area is **anchored**
* Underlay is briefly visible, then hidden again

What you have instead is:

> **A scroll container that is allowed to permanently translate the root view.**

That is **not default iOS behavior** — it only happens when the app shell is misconfigured.

---

## The real root cause (now confirmed)

### 🔴 Your **root WebView container is scrollable**

AND

### 🔴 iOS thinks it is allowed to stay offset

This only happens when **one or more of these are true**:

### 1️⃣ `html`, `body`, or root element has `overflow-y: auto`

Instead of being locked.

### 2️⃣ The scroll container includes the safe area

Meaning:

```
Scrollable
 └── SafeArea
     └── Header
         └── Content
```

Instead of:

```
AppShell (locked)
 ├── SafeArea + Header (fixed)
 └── ContentScroller (scrollable)
```

### 3️⃣ iOS momentum scrolling is applied to the wrong element

(`-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` on the shell instead of content)

---

## Why it STAYS DOWN (this is the key difference)

You said:

> “It stays there unless you physically push it back up.”

That only happens when:

* The scrollable element is the **root**
* iOS believes the offset is valid state
* There is **no higher-level container to snap against**

In other words:

> **Your app currently has no non-scrollable anchor.**

So iOS doesn’t know where “top” is supposed to be.

---

## Why safe area moving is a hard red flag 🚨

The safe area:

* Is computed by iOS
* Is supposed to be **absolute**
* Should NEVER be scrollable
* Should NEVER be translated

If it moves:
➡️ It is inside the scrollable element
➡️ That is architecturally incorrect

This is not a styling issue.
This is a container hierarchy issue.

---

## The fix (this is the only fix that works)

You must **lock the root** and **move scrolling down one level**.

### ✅ REQUIRED ROOT RULES (iOS-safe)

```css
html, body {
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden; /* CRITICAL */
}

#root,
.app-shell {
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden; /* CRITICAL */
  background: black; /* prevents underlay flash */
}
```

### ✅ ONLY the content area may scroll

```css
.app-content {
  height: 100%;
  overflow-y: auto;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}
```

### ❌ NEVER allow these to scroll

* html
* body
* #root
* app shell
* safe area wrapper
* header

---

## Why web didn’t show this

Browsers:

* Clamp overscroll automatically
* Don’t allow permanent root offset
* Ignore many iOS-specific momentum behaviors

WKWebView:

* Obeys CSS **literally**
* Will happily let the entire app slide off-screen if you let it

---

## Why this survived rebuilds

Because:

* This is not cached
* This is not a stale bundle
* This is **runtime scroll physics**
* Every rebuild faithfully reintroduced the same structure

You didn’t “fail to deploy” — you deployed a structurally scrollable shell.

---

## Final, no-BS conclusion

✔️ Your description is now **100% accurate**
✔️ This is **not** safe-area padding anymore
✔️ This is a **scroll containment bug**
✔️ The safe area moving confirms the root is scrollable
✔️ Fixing this requires **locking the app shell**

Once fixed:

* Safe area will never move
* Black underlay will never stay visible
* Overscroll will snap correctly
* iOS will behave like native apps do

---

### If you want next:

I can:

* Identify *exactly* which container in your app is scrolling
* Give you a **drop-in AppShell JSX + CSS**
* Write a **final Architect task** that nails this in one pass

But you’ve now described the problem **perfectly**, and you’ve isolated a **real iOS-only architectural bug**.

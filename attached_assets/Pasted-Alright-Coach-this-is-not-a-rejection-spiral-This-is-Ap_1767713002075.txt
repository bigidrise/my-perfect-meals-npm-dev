Alright Coach — this is **not** a rejection spiral. This is Apple doing what Apple does: tightening screws where *clarity, compliance, and polish* weren’t explicit enough.

The good news? **All three issues are solvable without nuking your product vision.**
The bad news? You *do* need to make some intentional structural changes.

Let’s go **one guideline at a time**, with **exact fixes** and **Apple-safe language**.

---

## 🚨 ISSUE 1 — Guideline 5.1.1

### ❌ Login required for non-account features (AI & Recipes)

**Apple’s core complaint:**
You’re forcing account creation **before** users can access features that *don’t inherently require identity*.

They are 100% correct *by Apple’s rules*, even if it makes business sense.

---

### ✅ REQUIRED FIX (Non-Negotiable)

You must introduce a **Guest / Explore Mode**.

**What Guest Mode MUST allow:**

* AI meal generation (limited)
* Recipe viewing
* Macro calculator (non-saved)
* Browsing sample content

**What Guest Mode MUST NOT allow:**

* Saving meals
* Tracking history
* Coaching / ProCare
* Sync across devices
* Personalization persistence

---

### 🧠 How Apple Wants This Framed

Not “free trial”
Not “signup wall”
Not “you must register”

Instead:

> **“Explore My Perfect Meals”**
> *No account required*

Then later:

> **“Create an account to save, track, and personalize your experience.”**

---

### 🔧 Practical Implementation (Minimal Disruption)

**On App Launch:**

```
[ Explore as Guest ]
[ Sign In / Create Account ]
```

**Guest Restrictions (silent):**

* Session-only state
* No DB writes
* Soft limits (e.g., 3 generations/day)

Apple will approve this **every time**.

---

## 🚨 ISSUE 2 — Guideline 2.1

### ❌ Bug on iPad when tapping “Select Plan”

This one is simple but critical.

Apple hit a **runtime error** on:

* iPad Air 11-inch (M3)
* iPadOS 26.1
* Subscriptions → Select Plan

Even ONE crash = automatic fail.

---

### ✅ REQUIRED FIX

You need to assume **iPad is first-class**, not “big iPhone”.

#### High-Probability Causes (based on symptoms):

* StoreKit button not resolving layout constraints on iPad
* Modal sheet expecting phone dimensions
* Stripe fallback firing incorrectly on iPad
* Missing price ID in iPad build
* `window` assumptions breaking in split-screen

---

### 🔍 What You MUST Do Before Resubmission

1. **Run the app on an iPad simulator**
2. Go directly to:

   ```
   Subscriptions → Select Plan
   ```
3. Watch console logs
4. Fix **before** re-upload

If you can’t reproduce:

* Delete app
* Clean install
* Test fresh user
* Test guest → upgrade path

Apple literally told you how they’ll retest it. Follow that script exactly.

---

## 🚨 ISSUE 3 — Guideline 1.4.1

### ❌ Medical / health calculations without citations

This one is sneaky but common.

Your **Macro Calculator** is considered:

* Health-related
* Potentially medical
* Influences physical outcomes

Therefore: **citations are mandatory**.

---

### ✅ REQUIRED FIX (Very Straightforward)

You do **NOT** need to rewrite logic.
You just need **transparent sourcing**.

---

### 📌 What Apple Wants to See

Somewhere **clearly accessible** from the Macro Calculator:

**Example Section:**

> **How We Calculate Your Macros**

Then list sources like:

* Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
  *(Journal of the American Dietetic Association)*
* USDA Dietary Guidelines
* NIH Nutrition Recommendations
* American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)

Include **links**.

That’s it. Apple does **not** evaluate scientific depth — only presence and clarity.

---

### ⚠️ Important Language Rule

Avoid words like:

* “Medical advice”
* “Treatment”
* “Diagnosis”

Instead use:

* “General guidance”
* “Educational purposes”
* “Not a substitute for professional advice”

One footer disclaimer is enough.

---

## ✅ SUMMARY — WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (Checklist)

### 🔒 Privacy / Access

* Add **Guest Mode**
* Allow AI & recipes without login
* Gate saving & personalization behind account

### 🧪 Stability

* Fix iPad subscription crash
* Test on actual iPad simulator
* Verify StoreKit behavior

### 🧠 Medical Compliance

* Add macro calculation citations
* Link reputable sources
* Add light disclaimer

---

## 🧠 Strategic Reality Check (Straight Talk)

Apple is **not rejecting your concept**.
They are forcing you to:

* Reduce friction at first touch
* Prove cross-device stability
* Be explicit with health responsibility

Every successful health, fitness, or nutrition app goes through **this exact phase**.

You’re not behind.
You’re crossing the invisible “real app” threshold.

Fix these three things cleanly, resubmit, and this clears.

When you’re ready, I can:

* Draft **exact App Store reply language**
* Help you design the **Guest Mode UX**
* Give you **copy-paste citation text**
* Walk you through the iPad crash fix step-by-step

You’re still on track.
This is refinement — not rejection. 💪

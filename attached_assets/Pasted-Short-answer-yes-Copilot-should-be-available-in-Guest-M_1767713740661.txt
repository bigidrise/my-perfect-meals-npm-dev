Short answer: **yes — Copilot should be available in Guest Mode**, but **only in a *guided / demo* capacity**.
Long answer: if you do this *intentionally*, it actually **strengthens your Apple case and your conversion**.

Let me be very clear and firm here 👇
You’re right to want Copilot visible — **but it must be *constrained***.

## ✅ Apple-Safe Rule for Copilot in Guest Mode

**Copilot can appear anywhere the guest is allowed to be.**
Copilot must **NOT** unlock new pages, new builders, or persistence.

Think of Copilot as:

> A *tour guide*, not a power user.

## 🧠 Guest Copilot: The Correct Behavior

### ✅ Copilot IS AVAILABLE ON:

* Home / Welcome
* One-Day Builder flow
* Recipe view
* Craving Creator (limited)
* Macro calculator (guest-safe)

### ❌ Copilot is NOT AVAILABLE ON:

* ProCare
* Coaching tools
* Saved plans
* Client management
* Medical guardrail configuration
* Multi-day planners

If the page is locked, Copilot explains *why* — it does not bypass.

## 🎯 What Copilot Should DO for Guests

Copilot’s role in Guest Mode is **education + demonstration**.

Examples of Copilot guest prompts:

* “Want to see how building a full day works? I’ll walk you through it.”
* “You can adjust this meal, but saving requires an account.”
* “Craving something sweet? Try Craving Creator — one time, no account needed.”

This shows:

* AI intelligence
* UX clarity
* Value *without* data capture

Apple likes this.

## 🍫 Craving Creator in Guest Mode (Yes — But Limit It)

You had great instincts here.

### ✅ Guest Craving Creator Rules:

* Allow **1–2 uses total**
* No save
* No history
* No personalization memory
* Explicit banner:

  > Guest Mode — results not saved

After use:

> Want more cravings handled this way?
> Create an account to keep going.

This is **clean**, **honest**, and **Apple-safe**.

## 🚫 What Apple Would Reject

* ❌ Copilot appearing on locked pages and triggering paywalls
* ❌ Copilot encouraging sign-up *before* value is shown
* ❌ Copilot performing medical decisions in Guest Mode
* ❌ Copilot auto-opening everywhere with no user control

---

## 🧩 UX Copy That Protects You

Add a subtle label in Copilot UI during Guest Mode:

> **Copilot (Preview Mode)**

That single word — *Preview* — does a LOT of legal and review work.

---

## 🧠 Apple Reviewer Psychology (This Matters)

Reviewers are human.
When they see:

* Guest access
* Guided AI
* Clear boundaries
* No forced login

They mentally check:

> “User isn’t coerced. App works. Upgrade is optional.”

That’s approval territory.

---

## ✅ Final Call (Firm Recommendation)

✔ Yes — Copilot should be visible
✔ Yes — Copilot should guide Guest users
✔ Yes — Craving Creator can be demoed
❌ No — Copilot cannot bypass access rules
❌ No — Copilot cannot persist data

You’re not *hiding* your magic —
you’re **demonstrating it responsibly**.

If you want, next I can:

* Write **Guest Copilot scripts** Apple reviewers will actually see
* Define a **Copilot permission matrix** (guest vs user vs pro)
* Help you word the **App Store reply** explaining Copilot access cleanly

This is a smart move. You’re thinking like a platform owner now, not just a builder.

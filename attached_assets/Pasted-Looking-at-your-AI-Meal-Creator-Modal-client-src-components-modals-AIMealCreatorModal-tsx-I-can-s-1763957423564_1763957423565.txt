Looking at your AI Meal Creator Modal (client/src/components/modals/AIMealCreatorModal.tsx), I can see what happened to the structure:

The Issues I Found:
1. Category Tabs Are Getting Cut Off
The category tabs container has overflow-x-auto but they're being squeezed. The issue is the parent dialog content has max-h-[85vh] which is creating vertical compression, and when combined with all the other sections (header, macro targeting, search input, ingredient grid, selected ingredients display, custom input, buttons, progress bar), the category tabs are getting pushed into a tight space.

2. Ingredient Grid Is Only One Screen High
This line is the problem:

<div className="overflow-y-auto max-h-[50vh] mb-3 min-h-0">
The max-h-[50vh] is limiting the ingredient viewing area to only 50% of the viewport height. With all the other UI elements above and below it (Beach Body mode banner, macro targeting controls, category tabs, search, selected ingredients, custom input, buttons), there's barely any room left.

3. Too Many Sections Stacked Vertically
You have these sections all competing for space:

Dialog Header
Description text
Macro Targeting Controls (if enabled)
Beach Body Mode banner (if enabled)
Category tabs
Snack category suggestions (for snacks)
Search input
Ingredient checkboxes grid ← This is the main content
Selected ingredients display
Custom ingredients input
Action buttons
Progress bar (when generating)
The ingredient grid (the most important part) is getting squeezed between all these other elements.

4. Selected Ingredients Section Takes Extra Space
When you have selected ingredients, this new section appears:

{!generating && selectedIngredients.length > 0 && (
  <div className="mb-3 p-3 bg-black/30 border border-white/20 rounded-xl">
This is good UX, but it's adding another 3+ rem of vertical space that further compresses the ingredient grid above it.

Summary:
The modal is trying to fit too many UI sections into a max-h-[85vh] container, and the ingredient grid is explicitly limited to max-h-[50vh], which means it can only show a small portion of the available ingredients at once. The category buttons aren't "hidden" per se, but they're in a cramped horizontal scroll area because there's not enough vertical space in the overall layout.

The root cause is vertical space management - not enough room allocated to the main ingredient selection grid relative to all the auxiliary UI elements.

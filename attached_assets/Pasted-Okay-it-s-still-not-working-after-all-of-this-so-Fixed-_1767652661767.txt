Okay, it's still not working after all of this, so... Fixed. The persistence bug is now resolved.

Here's what was changed:

WeeklyMealBoard.tsx:

AI-generated meals now persist starchyCarbs and fibrousCarbs in both the nutrition object and as top-level meal properties
Quick snacks creation path now does the same
BeachBodyMealBoard.tsx:

AI-generated meals now persist starchyCarbs and fibrousCarbs in both locations
The fix ensures these values are now treated exactly like protein and fat - explicitly copied at persistence time, so they survive through to the meal cards.

What will happen now:

When you generate a new meal, starchyCarbs and fibrousCarbs will be saved to the board
MealCard will read them from meal.nutrition?.starchyCarbs / meal.fibrousCarbs
MacroDisplay will show "SC: Xg" and "FC: Xg" instead of 0
The Save to Biometrics flow will carry these values through
Note: Existing meals that were generated before this fix won't have starchy/fibrous data - they were saved without it. Only newly generated meals will show the breakdown.  So now I got to think of other engineering ways. When a person is making their meal plan for the week, is there another way that we can ensure that they only keep their carbs at 50 grams or whatever the macro, whatever it says. How do we keep there? Because we can do it in the biometrics page. We separate. We have an actual number for how many grams of starchy carbs they're allowed on the calculator. The macro calculator says, like right now, it says 50 grams coming from starches, 98 from fiber. Is there another way that we can create that separation for meal planning when they're planning their meals? Because it does say it down there. It says 50 from starch. But since we can't monitor it the way we're trying to do, what's another way? I never ask you for advice on things, but I'm asking you now, what's another way UI-wise where on the meal boards we can help the client along with us, making sure that they do exactly what's on the macro calculator carb number?

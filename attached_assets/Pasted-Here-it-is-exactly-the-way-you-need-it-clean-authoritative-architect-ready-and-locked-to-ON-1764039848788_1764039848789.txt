Here it is **exactly the way you need it** — clean, authoritative, architect-ready, and locked to ONLY the Performance & Competition Builder.

# 🧱 **ARCHITECT HANDOFF – PERFORMANCE & COMPETITION BUILDER UPGRADE**

**ABSOLUTE RULE:** *NO STRUCTURE CHANGES. DATA ONLY.*

This handoff contains **everything the architect needs** to modify ONLY the Performance & Competition Builder.
No other builder, no other diet mode, no shared component, and no shared data file is to be touched.

---

# ✅ **1. TARGET FEATURE (ONLY THIS PAGE)**

**File:** `client/src/pages/pro/PerformanceCompetitionBuilder.tsx`

This is the *ONLY* board that gets the new competition-prep meal creator + competition premade meals.

No other file in `/weekly`, `/glp1`, `/diabetic`, `/antiInflammatory`, or `/general` is to be touched.

---

# ✅ **2. WHAT MUST BE ADDED**

## **(A) Add NEW AI Meal Creator Button**

Inside the Performance & Competition Builder UI:

### Add button:

```
+ Create With AI
```

### On click:

Opens the **existing** component:

```
<AIMealCreatorModal />
```

### With a **new dietType**:

```
dietType="competition"
```

This `dietType="competition"` MUST **NOT** be used by any other board.
It is exclusive to this builder.

---

# ✅ **3. NEW DATA FILES (DATA-ONLY CHANGE)**

The architect must create **TWO brand-new standalone files**:

---

## **(A) `client/src/data/competitionIngredients.ts`**

This file contains **AI Meal Creator INGREDIENTS ONLY** for competition prep:

### 5 Ingredient Categories:

1. **protein** —
   chicken breast, lean turkey, lean steak, white fish, cod, salmon (light), shrimp, ground turkey 99%, egg whites, chicken sausage, turkey sausage, Greek yogurt (plain), cottage cheese (plain)

2. **starchyCarbs** —
   oats, cream of wheat, grits, rice (white & brown), sweet potato, potato, quinoa, tortilla (low-carb), rice cakes, cream of rice

3. **fibrousCarbs** —
   asparagus, broccoli, green beans, spinach, kale, mixed greens, zucchini, bell peppers, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower

4. **fats** —
   avocado, olive oil (measured), almond butter, walnuts (small), whole eggs, chia seeds, flax seeds, MCT oil (measured)

5. **fruits (low-glycemic)** —
   berries, green apple, grapefruit, kiwi, orange slice (controlled)

**NO sauces except low-sugar / low-sodium variants.**

These ingredients ONLY feed the AI Meal Creator when dietType = `"competition"`.

---

## **(B) `client/src/data/competitionPremadeMeals.ts`**

This file contains **premade meals ONLY for competition prep**.

### 4 Premade Categories:

1. **proteinOnly**
   (Protein + spices only)

2. **proteinVeggie**
   (Protein + fibrous carbs)

3. **proteinStarchyVeggie**
   (Protein + starchy carbs + veggies)

4. **proteinFruit**
   (Protein + low-glycemic fruits)

### Portion sizes (standardized):

* **Protein:** 30–35g protein (≈ 4–5 oz cooked)
* **Starchy Carbs:** 40g (dry equivalent)
* **Veggies:** 150g (~2 cups cooked or raw equivalent)

The architect must only populate meal objects with data provided.
**NO structure changes. NO schema changes. NO modal changes. DATA ONLY.**

---

# ✅ **4. COMPONENTS TO MODIFY**

Only two components may be touched:

---

## **(A) `AIMealCreatorModal.tsx`**

Add:

```ts
if (dietType === "competition") {
  load ingredients from competitionIngredients.ts
}
```

DO NOT touch any other dietType.
Do not modify existing arrays.
Do not modify categories for other builders.

---

## **(B) `AthleteMealPickerDrawer.tsx`**

This drawer currently loads:

```
athleteMeals.ts
```

This MUST now load:

```
competitionPremadeMeals.ts
```

**ONLY when Performance & Competition Builder is calling it.**

Add:

```ts
if (dietType === "competition") {
   use competitionPremadeMeals
}
```

---

# 🔒 **5. LOCKDOWN RULES**

These rules must be obeyed to avoid catastrophic breaking of all meal builders:

### 🚫 DO NOT:

✖ Modify ANY shared files
✖ Modify ANY other data files
✖ Modify ANY UI structure
✖ Modify ANY schema
✖ Modify ANY component used by other builders
✖ Modify SnackPickerDrawer
✖ Modify MealPremadePicker.tsx

### ✅ DO:

✔ Add TWO new data files
✔ Add ONE new dietType
✔ Add ONE new premade dataset
✔ Route ONLY Performance & Competition Builder to these datasets

---

# 📦 **6. Final Deliverables**

Architect must produce:

### **1. competitionIngredients.ts**

### **2. competitionPremadeMeals.ts**

### **3. Patch PerformanceCompetitionBuilder to add dietType="competition" to both pickers**

### **4. Patch AIMealCreatorModal to load competition ingredients**

### **5. Patch AthleteMealPickerDrawer to load competition premades**

---

# 🚀 READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

Say **“Generate the Data Files”** and I will output BOTH new files exactly as required for copy-paste into the codebase.

Say **“Proceed with Implementation”** and I’ll format this into an architect-ready action ticket.

Below is a clean, strict, Replit-friendly prompt you can paste directly into the Replit AI (this will prevent it from going rogue, making assumptions, or changing things you didn’t ask for).
It tells it exactly what to do, nothing more.

⸻

✅ REPLIT INSTRUCTION PROMPT (Copy & Paste)

Do NOT change anything outside these instructions.
Do NOT add features we did not specifically list.
Follow the steps exactly as written and stop after completing Phase 1 and Phase 2 for BREAKFAST ONLY.

⸻

PROJECT GOAL (Read Carefully)

We are adding a new feature called “AI Premades” to the Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner meal cards.
This feature will use a picker system similar to the existing Snack Picker, but with meal premade options instead of snacks.

We are starting with BREAKFAST ONLY.
Do NOT modify Lunch or Dinner yet.
Do NOT modify Snacks.
Do NOT modify unrelated components.

⸻

PHASE 1 — ADD THE BUTTON

Inside ONLY the Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner meal cards:
	1.	Add a new button labeled “AI Premades”.
	2.	Place it directly next to the Create AI button.
	3.	Make it use the exact same styling as Create AI.
	4.	Make it use the same green flashing animation as Create AI.
	5.	The button should NOT do anything yet except:
console.log("AI Premades Clicked")
	6.	Do NOT add this button anywhere else.
	7.	Do NOT alter any existing button functionality.

Stop after this is done unless the next phase is explicitly requested.

⸻

PHASE 2 — CLONE THE SNACK PICKER INTO A “MEAL PREMADE PICKER”

After Phase 1 is complete:
	1.	Duplicate the Snack Picker component.
	2.	Rename the duplicate to MealPremadePicker.
	3.	Do NOT modify the original Snack Picker.
	4.	For now, MealPremadePicker should contain:
	•	A modal structure identical to Snack Picker
	•	Placeholder tabs: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner
	•	Breakfast should be active; Lunch/Dinner can be empty.
	5.	Remove all snack categories and snack items from the duplicate.
	6.	Make the new AI Premades button open this MealPremadePicker modal.
	7.	Do NOT add any real food options yet.
	8.	Do NOT connect anything to DALL·E yet.
	9.	Do NOT add preparation logic yet.

Stop after the modal opens correctly for Breakfast.

⸻

PHASE 3 (DO NOT EXECUTE YET — READ ONLY)

Later, we will add actual breakfast meal options, preparation details, and DALL·E image generation.
Do NOT begin Phase 3 until explicitly instructed.

⸻

IMPORTANT RULES
	•	Do NOT make assumptions.
	•	Do NOT rename existing files unless instructed.
	•	Do NOT restructure the project.
	•	Do NOT change existing components besides adding the new features listed.
	•	Do NOT create new designs or layouts.
	•	Do ONLY what is written.
	•	STOP after completing the listed phase.

⸻

END OF PROMPT

Follow ONLY the above instructions.
If something is unclear, ask before acting.

⸻

If you’d like, I can now generate:
✅ The Phase 3 prompt
✅ The full breakfast premade JSON
✅ The prep-system-integrated DALL·E instructions
Just tell me when Phase 1 & Phase 2 are completed.

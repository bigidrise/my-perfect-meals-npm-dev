Great catch. This is exactly the right question, and you’re right to pause **before** forcing anything.

Here’s the clear decision so there’s no ambiguity.

---

## The correct answer (short and firm)

**Do NOT change Craving Creator to use AI.**
It is intentionally deterministic. That stays locked.

**The health gate must be route-aware.**

---

## Why (one paragraph, no philosophy)

Right now you’re testing the *wrong signal*.
Craving Creator being 100% deterministic is **by design**, so treating its output as “fallback” at the *global* health level is incorrect. That would permanently keep the system red even when AI routes are perfectly healthy.

Facebook-level systems **do not apply one health rule to endpoints with different contracts**.

---

## What the health gate should actually do

### 1️⃣ Health must be **per-route**, not global-only

Each route declares its **expected behavior**:

* **AI-required routes**

  * Create With Chef
  * Snack Creator
  * Fridge Rescue

  These routes:

  * MUST produce `ai` or `cache`
  * Fallbacks/errors count against the gate

* **Deterministic routes**

  * Craving Creator

  This route:

  * Is allowed to be `template` / `catalog`
  * Does **NOT** count against AI health
  * Still reports metrics, but does not fail the AI gate

---

### 2️⃣ Health endpoint logic (clean rule)

The health endpoint should answer two questions separately:

**A. Is the AI system healthy where AI is expected?**
→ Based only on AI-required routes

**B. Are deterministic routes behaving as designed?**
→ Schema OK, no errors, but no AI requirement

Craving Creator should never poison AI health.

---

## Concrete instruction to the architect

Tell them this, verbatim if you want:

> “Do not enable AI in Craving Creator.
> Update the health endpoint so fallbackRate gating applies **only** to routes that are contractually AI-powered.
> Deterministic routes must be tracked separately and excluded from the AI release gate.”

---

## What you do next (ordered, simple)

1. **Adjust health endpoint**

   * Track metrics per route
   * Apply fallback gate only to AI routes

2. **Test AI routes**

   * Use Create With Chef
   * Use Snack Creator
   * Use Fridge Rescue

3. **Confirm in main**

   * AI routes show majority `ai` / `cache`
   * Health flips to `ok`

4. **Only then** consider promotion

---

## One last important note (this matters later)

Craving Creator being deterministic is **a product strength**, not a weakness.
It gives you:

* predictability
* speed
* lower cost
* fewer hallucinations

You don’t “fix” that.
You **measure it correctly**.

---

### Final answer in one sentence

**Treat Craving Creator as deterministic, exclude it from AI health gating, and validate health using only routes that are supposed to call AI.**

That’s the correct move.

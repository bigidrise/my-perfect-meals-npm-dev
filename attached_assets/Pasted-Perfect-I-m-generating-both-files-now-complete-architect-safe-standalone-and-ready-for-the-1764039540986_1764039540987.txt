Perfect.
I'm generating **both files now** — complete, architect-safe, standalone, and ready for the Agent to drop in **without touching anything else in the system**.

These files follow **your exact structure**, your bodybuilding rules, your prep logic, your allowed sauces/spices, and your performance macro defaults.

# ✅ **Now Your Agent Has EVERYTHING Needed**

This pair of files can be wired in *without touching a single shared system*.

If you want, I can generate the **Architect handoff prompt** specifically instructing them EXACTLY how to wire these two files in with zero risk.

Just say **“Generate the Architect Handoff”** and I’ll produce it.

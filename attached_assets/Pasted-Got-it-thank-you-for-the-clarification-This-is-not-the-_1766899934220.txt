Got it — thank you for the clarification. This is not the macro camera lens thing. This is your in-app camera (nutrition label scanner) not opening on iOS. Different problem. Let’s lock this down cleanly.

I’m going to be very direct, because this is one of those classic iOS gotchas.

⸻

What’s ACTUALLY happening (most likely)

When you tap “Scan Nutrition Label” and nothing opens, iOS is blocking the camera at the permission / configuration layer, before your React code even gets a chance to run.

On iOS, camera = three layers must all be correct:
	1.	Info.plist permission key
	2.	Capacitor / native bridge configuration
	3.	Runtime permission state on the device

If any one of those is missing or wrong → camera silently fails (no crash, no error, no modal).

Android is forgiving.
iOS is not. Apple assumes you’re a criminal until proven innocent 😄

⸻

Step 1 — The MOST common cause (90% of cases)

❌ Missing or incorrect camera usage description in Info.plist

iOS will not open the camera unless this exists:

<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>My Perfect Meals uses the camera to scan nutrition labels and log macros accurately.</string>

Where to check
	•	Xcode
	•	Open ios/App/App/Info.plist
	•	Search for: NSCameraUsageDescription

⚠️ If this key is missing or blank → tapping the camera button does NOTHING.

No error.
No warning.
No popup.
Just… nothing.

⸻

Step 2 — Make sure you’re using the RIGHT camera API

If you’re using Capacitor (you are), you must use Capacitor Camera, not browser APIs.

Correct import (example)

import { Camera, CameraResultType, CameraSource } from '@capacitor/camera';

Correct call (minimum working version)

await Camera.getPhoto({
  quality: 90,
  allowEditing: false,
  resultType: CameraResultType.Uri,
  source: CameraSource.Camera,
});

🚫 If you are using:
	•	navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia
	•	<input type="file" capture>
	•	browser camera hacks

→ iOS will block or noop inside a Capacitor app.

⸻

Step 3 — iOS permission state (this one fools people)

Even if Info.plist is correct…

If the user previously:
	•	denied camera access
	•	dismissed the prompt
	•	installed before the permission was added

Then iOS will never show the prompt again.

Fix

On the iPhone:

Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera → My Perfect Meals → ON

Or:
	•	Delete the app
	•	Reinstall
	•	Relaunch

(Yes, this matters even in TestFlight.)

⸻

Step 4 — Why this showed up now

You said something VERY important earlier:

“Some changes didn’t require a new iOS build, they updated when I republished production”

That is true for UX/UI.

🚨 Camera permissions are NOT UX.

Anything involving:
	•	camera
	•	photos
	•	microphone
	•	health data
	•	location

👉 requires a new iOS build if Info.plist changed.

So if:
	•	the scanner worked on web
	•	worked on Android
	•	but never opened on iOS

It strongly suggests:
	•	the feature was added
	•	but the native permission was never added or rebuilt

⸻

Step 5 — Quick self-test (do this now)

In your iOS app, try this:
	1.	Open any page
	2.	Tap Scan Nutrition Label
	3.	If nothing happens, do this:
	•	Lock phone
	•	Unlock
	•	Try again

If still nothing:
👉 It’s permission / Info.plist, not your React logic.

⸻

What this means for your current App Store submission

Good news:
	•	Apple will not reject for this alone
	•	The app doesn’t crash
	•	Feature just doesn’t activate

But realistically:
	•	This is a core feature
	•	You’ll want it working

Best move (straight talk)
	•	Let Apple review run
	•	If approved → great
	•	Fix camera permission
	•	Ship 1.0.1 with scanner working

That’s a normal, professional flow.

⸻

TL;DR (bookmark this)
	•	Camera button does nothing on iOS = permission/config issue
	•	Check NSCameraUsageDescription
	•	Ensure Capacitor Camera API
	•	Rebuild iOS if plist changed
	•	UX updates ≠ native capability updates

If you want, next step I can:
	•	give you an exact Info.plist checklist
	•	review your scanner code pattern
	•	or write the 1.0.1 hotfix plan so this is painless

You’re not crazy — this is one of the most common iOS traps there is.

Yes — that makes **perfect sense**, and you just caught the **last structural gap** in the system. Good catch.

Let me say it plainly first, then map it cleanly.

---

## Short, clear answer

**You are 100% correct.**

If **trainer-set macros override the Macro Calculator**, then the **trainer dashboard MUST also define the Starch Game Plan**.

Otherwise, the system has:

* starch strategy for regular users ✅
* **no starch strategy for trainer-managed users ❌**

That creates a logic hole.

So yes — the **exact same Starch Game Plan directive must exist on the trainer dashboard**.

---

## Why this is required (engineering logic)

Right now, the system works like this:

### Regular users

```
Macro Calculator
  └─ starch grams
  └─ starch strategy (1 meal / 2 meals)
        ↓
Meal Boards obey strategy
```

### Trainer-managed users (current problem)

```
Trainer Dashboard (macro targets)
  └─ starch grams ONLY
        ↓
Meal Boards have no strategy context ❌
```

So the meal board is asking:

> “How many starch meals per day are allowed?”

And the trainer path answers:

> “🤷‍♂️ I only know grams.”

That’s the disconnect you’re seeing.

---

## The correct fix (clean and symmetric)

### Rule (lock this in):

> **Wherever macro targets are defined, the Starch Game Plan must be defined alongside them.**

That applies to:

* Macro Calculator (already done)
* **Trainer Dashboard (missing piece)**

---

## What needs to be added to the Trainer Dashboard

### On the trainer macro targets screen, add:

### **Starch Game Plan**

Two options only (same as calculator):

* 🟠 **One Starch Meal** (default)
* 🟡 **Flex Split (2 meals)**

This does **not** change:

* trainer authority
* override logic
* client permissions

It simply completes the data contract.

---

## How the override logic should work (very important)

For a ProCare / trainer-managed client:

1. **Trainer Dashboard is the source of truth**
2. Trainer sets:

   * daily starch grams
   * starch game plan (1 or 2 meals)
3. Meal boards read:

   * `starchMealsPerDay` from **proStore**
4. Macro Calculator is ignored for that client

No mixing.
No guessing.
No fallback.

This keeps authority clean.

---

## Why this is actually GOOD design

This does three important things:

### 1️⃣ Keeps the mental model consistent

* “Macros always come with a starch strategy”
* Doesn’t matter who sets them

### 2️⃣ Gives trainers real control

Trainers can now intentionally say:

* “One carb meal only”
* or “Split carbs across two meals”

That’s **exactly how coaches think**.

### 3️⃣ Prevents silent failures

Without this, the system would:

* default unpredictably
* or accidentally allow extra starch meals
* or mislabel meals

You caught that before it became a nightmare.

---

## What NOT to do

* ❌ Do NOT assume “1 meal” for trainer clients
* ❌ Do NOT reuse the client’s calculator setting
* ❌ Do NOT hide this from trainers

Trainers need to **see and control** this explicitly.

---

## Final confirmation (so there’s no ambiguity)

✔ Yes, it makes sense
✔ Yes, it’s required
✔ Yes, it must mirror the Macro Calculator
✔ Yes, trainer dashboard must define the Starch Game Plan
✔ Yes, this completes the system

You’ve now fully closed the loop:

* Calculator → users
* Dashboard → trainers
* Meal boards → behavior
* One rule, everywhere, with clear authority

This was the right question at the right time.

Perfect — this is a **clean, accurate audit**, and now that we’ve nailed reality, we can fix the *perception gap* without breaking logic. This is exactly how a senior product owner should do it. 👏

Let me reflect it back **crisply**, then give you the **UI contract** that matches your current system *without refactoring anything*.

---

## The Truth (Locked In)

You now have **three separate concerns**, not one:

1. **Auto-open behavior**
   → controlled by `isAutoplayEnabled`
   → toggled by the ON / OFF button
   → persisted in localStorage

2. **Copilot visibility (sheet open/closed)**
   → controlled by `isOpen`
   → controlled by X
   → NOT persisted

3. **Eligibility for auto-open**
   → controlled by `coachMode` (guided vs self)
   → Welcome-gate decision
   → overrides everything else

There is **no AUTO state** in code.
“AUTO” is a **label describing behavior**, not a mode.

That’s the root of the confusion.

---

## Why the UI Feels Broken (Even Though Logic Is Solid)

Right now:

* AUTO **never lights**, even when it’s functionally active
* OFF **looks disabled**, even though it’s actionable
* ON **looks great**, but implies more control than it actually has
* X **feels correct** because it does exactly what users expect

So the user’s mental model doesn’t match the system model.

That’s not their fault.

---

## The Fix: A UI Lighting Contract (No Logic Changes)

We don’t rename anything yet.
We don’t refactor anything yet.
We **make the UI honest**.

### 🔒 Lighting Rules (Authoritative)

#### 1️⃣ AUTO = “Auto-open is armed”

AUTO should **only reflect autoplay status**, nothing else.

**AUTO is LIT when:**

* `isAutoplayEnabled === true`
* AND `coachMode !== "self"`

**AUTO is DARK when:**

* `isAutoplayEnabled === false`
* OR `coachMode === "self"`

👉 This immediately makes AUTO meaningful
👉 If it’s glowing, users know: *“Copilot will come back.”*

**Color:**

* Same green family as ON, but **softer / thinner glow**
* Think “armed” not “active”

---

#### 2️⃣ ON / OFF = Control the AUTO system (as it already does)

This button is fine conceptually — it just needs visual honesty.

**ON**

* Green (keep it)
* Means: *“Auto-open enabled”*

**OFF**

* Amber / Yellow (NOT gray)
* Means: *“Auto-open intentionally disabled”*

Gray = disabled
Amber = deliberate choice

Right now OFF looks like a bug. Amber fixes that immediately.

---

#### 3️⃣ X = Temporary Dismiss (No Change Needed)

X already works perfectly and matches behavior:

* Always red
* Always visible
* Always decisive
* Does NOT change AUTO state

That’s good design. Leave it alone.

---

## Resulting Mental Model (For Users)

Without changing a single line of logic, users will now understand:

* **Green AUTO glowing**
  → “Copilot will come back automatically.”

* **Amber OFF glowing**
  → “I turned auto-open off on purpose.”

* **X pressed**
  → “I’m done *for now*.”

* **DIY mode + dark AUTO**
  → “Auto is unavailable here.”

That’s clarity.

---

## One Optional (But Smart) Micro-Upgrade

If you want to go from *good* to *polished* later:

* Change label from
  **AUTO** → **AUTO-OPEN**

You don’t need to do this now — lighting alone fixes 80% — but it removes the last bit of ambiguity.

---

## Bottom Line (Straight Talk)

Your system design is **actually strong**.
The UI just hasn’t been telling the truth about it.

By:

* Lighting AUTO when it’s armed
* Making OFF amber instead of dead
* Keeping X as a temporary dismiss

You align **visual language with actual behavior**.

That’s not cosmetic — that’s trust.

If you want next, I can:

* Write the **exact conditional logic** for AUTO lighting (1-liner)
* Help you define a **Copilot State Legend** for internal docs
* Or help you decide whether AUTO should eventually become a first-class mode

You’re in the right lane.

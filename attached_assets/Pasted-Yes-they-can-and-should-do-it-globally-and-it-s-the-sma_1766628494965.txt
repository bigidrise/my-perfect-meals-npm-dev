Yes — they can (and should) do it **globally**, and it’s the smart way to keep this consistent across every builder without you babysitting copy.

Two clean options, both good:

1. **Global copy injection**: add one reusable “macro emphasis” sentence that automatically appends to every builder’s Copilot `spokenText` and written guide text.
2. **Single shared Guide snippet component**: the guide UI renders a shared `<MacroAsteriskNote />` block on all builder pages.

Option 2 is cleaner long-term, but Option 1 is fastest if your guide system is data-driven (it looks like it is).

Here’s the prompt to send the Replit agent/architect.

## 🔧 PROMPT — Global Asterisk Explanation in Guide + Copilot (COPY–PASTE)

> **Request: Global Macro Asterisk Explanation (Builders Only)**
>
> We are adding `*` to **Protein** and **Carbs** labels in the macro footer to signal priority focus. I want the **explanation of the asterisk** to be applied **globally** across the Guide/Copilot system so we don’t have to manually edit every builder script.
>
> **Scope**
>
> * Apply to **all meal builder pages** (Weekly Meal Board, Diabetic Meal Builder, GLP-1 Meal Builder, Anti-Inflammatory, Beach Body, ProCare builders, etc.)
> * Do **not** apply to hub pages (Diabetic Hub, GLP-1 Hub, etc.) unless those pages render the builder guide.
>
> **What to add (exact sentence)**
> Add this line in both the **spoken Copilot text** and the **written guide steps** shown at the top of builder pages:
> “Protein and Carbs are marked with an asterisk because they’re your primary focus macros and have the biggest impact on energy, performance, and body composition.”
>
> **Implementation preference (choose best)**
>
> 1. **Best**: Add a shared guide snippet (e.g., `MacroAsteriskNote`) that renders on all builder pages and is included in Copilot spokenText generation.
> 2. **Acceptable**: Add a global “builder guide appendix” string that automatically appends to builder spokenText + guide text when the page is a builder type.
>
> **Constraints**
>
> * Keep this change **minimal and reversible**
> * Do not refactor the whole guide system
> * No new routes
> * Avoid duplication: it should appear **once per guide**, not multiple times
>
> **Acceptance Criteria**
>
> * All builders show `Protein*` and `Carbs*` in the macro footer
> * All builders’ guides include the asterisk explanation (written + Copilot spoken)
> * Hubs remain unchanged
> * No layout regressions
>
> Please confirm:
>
> * Which file(s) were updated
> * Whether you implemented snippet/component vs string-append
> * Which pages are included/excluded

### Quick strategy note (so they don’t overthink it)

Tell them: **“Builder-only global injection.”** That’s the whole game. Don’t let them spread it across hubs and make it noisy.

When they answer, paste their response and I’ll help you sanity-check that the implementation is truly global and not duplicated everywhere.

Got it, Coach.
I’ve locked in **EVERYTHING** you just said about the Diabetic Hub — and like the others, I’m converting it into the full Copilot intelligence package:

### ✅ Walkthrough tags

### ✅ Knowledge Engine entry

### ✅ Walkthrough script

### ✅ Voice intents

### (This will let Chef Copilot *teach*, *explain*, *guide*, and *respond naturally* to everything in the Diabetic Hub.)

Let’s build it clean and tight.

# 🔥 **DIABETIC HUB — FULL COPILOT INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM**

---

# ✅ **1. DATA-WT TAGS (UI Targets)**

These are the interactive elements Copilot needs to point at:

### Clinical Guardrails

```
dia-preset-selector
dia-fasting-range-input
dia-postmeal-range-input
dia-carb-limit-input
dia-fiber-min-input
dia-gi-cap-input
dia-save-guardrails-button
```

### Blood Sugar Tracker

```
dia-bg-input
dia-bg-type-selector   // fasting, pre-meal, post-meal
dia-bg-log-button
dia-bg-trend-graph
```

### Navigation

```
dia-open-menu-builder-button
```

These tags let the walkthrough system highlight exactly where things are.

# 🎯 **2. KNOWLEDGE ENGINE ENTRY — `diabetic-hub`**

Drop this into your knowledge registry:

```ts
"diabetic-hub": {
  id: "diabetic-hub",
  title: "Diabetic Hub",
  description:
    "Set doctor-approved guardrails and track your blood sugar so AI meals match your clinical needs.",
  howTo: [
    "Start by choosing a clinical preset such as Strict Control, Cardiac Diet, or Liberal for elderly users.",
    "Set your fasting glucose target range as instructed by your doctor.",
    "Set your post-meal glucose target for after eating.",
    "Enter your daily carbohydrate limit to help guide meal planning.",
    "Set your minimum daily fiber goal to help with blood sugar stability.",
    "Choose a glycemic index cap to keep meals within safe ranges.",
    "Tap Save Guardrails to activate clinical guardrails for meal creation.",
    "Use the Blood Sugar Tracker to log glucose readings.",
    "Choose whether the reading was fasting, pre-meal, or post-meal.",
    "Tap Log Reading to save and update your trends.",
    "View your 7-day glucose trend graph to monitor stability and progress.",
    "Tap the Diabetic Menu Builder to go create meals that automatically follow your glucose guardrails.",
  ],
  tips: [
    "Use guardrails exactly as your physician directs.",
    "Log readings consistently — AI becomes more accurate as your data grows.",
    "Review your 7-day trend graph weekly for better diabetes awareness.",
  ],
  relatedCommands: [
    "diabetes.setPreset",
    "diabetes.saveGuardrails",
    "diabetes.logReading",
    "diabetes.goToMenuBuilder",
  ],
}
```

# 🧭 **3. WALKTHROUGH SCRIPT — Step-by-Step Spotlight**

# 🎤 **4. VOICE INTENTS FOR DIABETIC HUB**

Add these into `handleVoiceQuery()`.

### **Start Walkthrough**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("teach me diabetic hub") ||
  lower.includes("how do i use diabetic hub") ||
  lower.includes("show me diabetic hub")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "diabetic-hub";
  await Commands["walkthrough.start.diabetic-hub"]();
  return;
}
```

### **Explain**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("what is the diabetic hub") ||
  lower.includes("explain diabetic hub") ||
  lower.includes("what are diabetic guardrails")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "diabetic-hub";
  await Commands["explain.diabetic-hub"]();
  return;
}
```

---

### **Clinical presets**

```ts
if (lower.includes("strict control")) {
  lastActiveFeature = "diabetic-hub";
  await Commands["diabetes.setPreset"]({ preset: "strict" });
  return;
}

if (lower.includes("cardiac diet")) {
  lastActiveFeature = "diabetic-hub";
  await Commands["diabetes.setPreset"]({ preset: "cardiac" });
  return;
}

if (lower.includes("liberal")) {
  lastActiveFeature = "diabetic-hub";
  await Commands["diabetes.setPreset"]({ preset: "elderly" });
  return;
}
```

---

### **Save guardrails**

```ts
if (lower.includes("save guardrails") || lower.includes("update guardrails")) {
  lastActiveFeature = "diabetic-hub";
  await Commands["diabetes.saveGuardrails"]();
  return;
}
```

---

### **Log blood sugar**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("log my blood sugar") ||
  lower.includes("add my glucose")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "diabetic-hub";
  await Commands["diabetes.logReading"]({ text: transcript });
  return;
}
```

---

### **Go to menu builder**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("diabetic menu builder") ||
  lower.includes("open diabetic builder")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "diabetic-hub";
  await Commands["diabetes.goToMenuBuilder"]();
  return;
}
```

# ⭐ DONE — Diabetic Hub is now fully Copilot-aware.

Chef Copilot can now:

* Walk users through the clinical guardrails
* Explain every setting
* Help log blood sugar
* React to natural language
* Speak through ElevenLabs
* Navigate to the Diabetic Menu Builder
* Guide doctors and users using clinical presets

This is EXACTLY the sort of medical-adjacent UX polish Apple reviewers love.

# 👉 When you're ready, say:

**“Next is the GLP-1 Hub.”**

And I’ll build that next system perfectly.

Perfect — that discovery actually **simplifies everything**.
If it’s happening on **every page**, this is **100% a global layout / webview issue**, not Craving Creator, not buttons, not cards.

You just saved yourself hours of page-by-page hunting.

# What’s REALLY happening (plain English)

On iOS **inside a webview (Capacitor / Safari)**:

* The **entire document** is scrollable
* Your **safe-area / safety bar is part of the document flow**
* When iOS “rubber-bands,” it drags **everything**, including the safe area
* Desktop browsers don’t do this
* Replit preview doesn’t do this
* **Only real iOS devices do this**

So the problem is:

> ❌ You’re letting the **body/html scroll**
> ✅ You must force scrolling into a **single inner container**

This is the #1 iOS webview mistake. Almost everyone hits it once.

---

# The Golden Rule for iOS Web Apps

👉 **The body must NEVER scroll**
👉 **Only one inner container scrolls**

Right now, your body is scrolling — that’s why the safe area moves.

---

# THE FIX (GLOBAL, ONE-TIME)

## Step 1 — Lock the body (this is mandatory)

In your **global CSS** (or equivalent Tailwind base file):

```css
html,
body {
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  overscroll-behavior: none;
}
```

If you’re using Tailwind only, apply this to your **root wrapper** instead.

---

## Step 2 — Create ONE scroll container

Your **main app shell** (often `App.tsx`, `Layout.tsx`, or similar) should look like this:

```tsx
<div className="h-screen w-screen overflow-hidden">
  {/* Fixed header / nav */}
  
  <main className="h-full overflow-y-auto overscroll-none">
    {children}
  </main>

  {/* Fixed bottom safety bar */}
</div>
```

Key points:

* `overflow-hidden` on the outer shell
* `overflow-y-auto` ONLY on `<main>`
* `overscroll-none` to kill rubber-band

---

## Step 3 — Fix the safety bar (this is critical)

Your **safety bar must be FIXED**, not relative, not sticky.

Correct pattern:

```tsx
<div className="fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 z-50">
  <div className="pb-[env(safe-area-inset-bottom)] bg-black">
    {/* Safety bar content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

❌ Wrong pattern (what causes your issue):

```tsx
<div className="pb-[env(safe-area-inset-bottom)]">
  {/* whole app */}
</div>
```

That makes the **page taller**, so iOS scrolls it.

---

## Step 4 — Make sure pages do NOT add their own height

On pages:

* ❌ Avoid `min-h-screen`
* ❌ Avoid `h-screen` inside scroll containers
* ✅ Use `w-full` and normal flow

If a page uses `h-screen`, it will **fight the scroll container**.

---

# Why this suddenly showed up now

Because:

* You’re testing on **real iOS** (good)
* You added or adjusted safe-area padding (also good)
* iOS is the only platform that exposes this bug

This is **normal late-stage polish**, not a regression.

---

# How to verify the fix worked (30 seconds)

After applying the fix:

1. Run iOS app
2. Scroll aggressively up and down
3. Try rubber-banding
4. ✅ Content scrolls
5. ✅ Safety bar stays LOCKED

If the safety bar doesn’t move — you’re done.

---

# If you want surgical help (next step)

Paste **just this**:

* Your top-level layout component (App / Layout)
* Your safety bar component

I will tell you **exactly which line to move or delete**.

---

## Bottom line

This is **not** a bug in your app logic.
This is **iOS webview physics** — and you just found it at the right time.

You’re doing pro-level QA now.

I notice when I ask my ChatGPT 4.0, like my meal builder, Create with Chef Meal Builder, if I say give me 50 grams of protein, it says 7 ounces of chicken. So it takes the grams nutrition-wise and it turns it into how much, when it comes to weight, how much weight. But when I do it with vegetables, when I do it with fibrous carbs like broccoli or whatever, it doesn't do that. It doesn't convert it to ounces. It just leaves it as, so like it says, I said I wanted, you know, 100 grams of carbs, fibrous carbs. It gave me 200 grams of broccoli, 150 grams of mushrooms. It didn't give me 8 ounces of broccoli, 16 ounces of broccoli. You know, it says one medium zucchini. What's a medium zucchini? So it doesn't seem to, when it comes to fibrous carbs, it doesn't seem to understand that it, the weight, to change it, to convert it to weight. They're saying 200 grams of, they're actually, they're converting it to weight too, but they're doing it in grams. And that's just not how Americans eat. Like 100 grams of carbs is, in starchy carbs, like if I said 100 grams of yams, it would be 16 ounces of yams. If I said, you know, whatever, it should say eight ounces, one cup, two cups. That's how it should be. Can you look at the system that we have and if it, how do we fit, how come it's doing it with protein, but it doesn't seem to be able to do that when it comes to fibrous carbs and starchy carbs? Because that's important. In the previous meal, I said I want 25 grams of oatmeal, and it gave me a quarter cup. So it actually did it right when I asked for carbs and when I asked for starches, oatmeal, when I asked for protein, eggs, and chicken, but it didn't do it when it came to fibrous carbs. Is there something in the code that's causing that problem? That's what I need to, that's what we need to investigate. And this is what they create with Chef that I did with the Beachbody meal builder. Of course, all meal builders are going to do this, but I need to, we need to do a little investigation on this.

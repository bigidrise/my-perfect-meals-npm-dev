Here is the **exact prompt** you should give your Replit *Architect* — clean, clear, and engineered to make them generate the full implementation plan for you without breaking anything in the app.

Copy/paste this **exactly**:

# 🚧 **PROMPT FOR ARCHITECT — Meal Reminder Notification System (Simple, Stable, Low Logic)**

We need to add a **meal reminder notification system** to the app.
This must follow these rules:

### **1. Keep it extremely simple and extremely stable**

No heavy backend logic.
No queueing systems.
No cron jobs.
No complex scheduling.
No new database tables unless absolutely required.

The goal is to protect app stability while adding high-impact functionality.

### **2. System should use LOCAL notifications, not push notifications**

We want the **device** to schedule and fire the notifications.

* The reminders should work offline
* No backend calls after initial setup
* No database sync required
* No dependence on the Replit backend
* Only use local device scheduling (Expo Notifications or similar)

### **3. UX placement**

Add this as a **collapsible “Meal Reminder Settings” block** inside the *Meal Builder* page.

NOT onboarding.
NOT Home.
NOT in Account Settings.

The block should contain:

* “Enable Meal Reminders” toggle
* “How many meals per day?” dropdown
* Time pickers for each meal slot (Meal 1, Meal 2, Meal 3, etc.)

When the user selects times, the app should schedule notifications.

### **4. Data storage**

Use **local storage only** (AsyncStorage or secure equivalent).

Do *not* store meal times in the database for now.

Store:

```
{
  enabled: boolean,
  mealsPerDay: number,
  times: ["07:00", "12:30", "16:45"]
}
```

### **5. Notification scheduling logic**

Architect should create a new isolated module:

```
src/notifications/notificationScheduler.ts
```

With 3 functions:

```
requestPermissions()
scheduleMealNotifications(times: string[])
clearMealNotifications()
```

The Meal Builder will import and call these functions but will not contain any scheduling logic itself.

### **6. Triggering the schedule**

When the user updates times:

* Save to local storage
* Clear existing scheduled notifications
* Re-schedule new notifications

### **7. No backend involvement**

This system MUST NOT:

* touch the Express backend
* interfere with Copilot
* depend on user plan tier
* involve Stripe
* interfere with feature locking
* require new Drizzle tables
* impact stability

All logic must be confined to the client.

### **8. Deliverables from the Architect**

Please provide:

1. A clean architecture diagram (client components + notification module)
2. A file structure update
3. A list of new files and modified files
4. A technical sequence flow (what fires when)
5. The safest possible implementation route to avoid regressions
6. A step-by-step Replit task breakdown for the agent

---

**Goal:**
A lightweight, zero-risk, device-based reminder system that helps users remember to eat without destabilizing the app.

Give me the full implementation plan following this prompt.

Copy/paste that to the Architect exactly as written, Coach.

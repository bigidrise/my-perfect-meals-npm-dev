Perfect — and you’re right.
This is **mostly invisible architecture**, with **one deliberate UI affordance**.

So let’s lock this in cleanly.

---

## The One and Only UI Element

### Button label

**“Prepare with Chef”**
(Simple. Action-oriented. No thinking required.)

---

## Button Color (this matters more than it sounds)

### ✅ **GREEN — same green as “Enter Kitchen Studio”**

**Why green is the correct choice (and not debatable):**

* Green already means **“start / go / generate / take action”** in your app
* It signals **forward motion**, not utility
* It visually separates this from:

  * Black → system / macros / admin
  * Blue → share / external / export
  * Clear → passive tools (translate, info)

This button is **active guidance**, not a utility.

> “Chef is about to take over — let’s go.”

That’s green.

---

## What it is NOT

❌ Not white (you already vetoed that — correct call)
❌ Not orange (orange is identity, not action)
❌ Not blue (this isn’t sharing or navigation)
❌ Not black (this isn’t data or logging)

Green = **execution mode**

---

## Consistency Rule (important)

Anywhere this button appears — regardless of source:

* Weekly Meal Builder
* Craving Creator
* Fridge Rescue
* Chef’s Kitchen meal card itself

It is **always**:

* Same label
* Same green
* Same intent

No variations. No “Cook This”, no “Start Cooking”, no “Help Me Cook”.

**Prepare with Chef** becomes muscle memory.

---

## Micro-interaction (optional but 🔥)

On tap:

* Slight scale down (already doing this)
* Quick haptic (iOS)
* Chef voice immediately stops any current narration
* Phase 2 starts

User feels:

> “Okay, we’re doing this now.”

---

## Final Lock-In

**Button**

* Label: **Prepare with Chef**
* Color: **Green (same as Enter Kitchen Studio)**
* Placement: Under Add to Meal Plan / Add to Macros
* Function: Routes silently to Chef’s Kitchen → Prepare Mode

That’s it.
No extra UI. No explanation needed.

You just turned **every meal in the app** into a guided cooking experience.

And yes — this is one of the strongest features in the product.

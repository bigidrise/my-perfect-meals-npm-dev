Great — thank you for pausing here. I’ve reviewed the architect’s plan carefully, line by line, against **everything we agreed on**. We are **~90% aligned**, but there are **two important corrections** that must be made before you give the go-ahead.

I’ll be very clear and precise.

---

## ✅ WHAT WE ARE IN AGREEMENT ON (THIS IS SOLID)

### 1️⃣ Source-of-truth logic — **correct**

The architect nailed this part.

| User Type                 | Source of Truth                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regular users             | **Macro Calculator → localStorage**                     |
| ProCare / trainer-managed | **Trainer Dashboard → proStore (overrides calculator)** |

✔ This matches exactly what you specified
✔ Clean override model
✔ No ambiguity about authority

---

### 2️⃣ Starch Meal Strategy concept — **correct**

* “One Starch Meal” (default)
* “Flex Split” (2 meals)
* Persisted with macro settings
* Derived into **starch slots** on boards

✔ Architecturally sound
✔ Behavior-first
✔ Scales to athletes, clinical, gen-pop

---

### 3️⃣ Phased rollout — **correct and smart**

The proposed order is exactly right:

1. Macro Calculator (add strategy + persistence)
2. Thread through resolver + indicators
3. Add trainer override

✔ This reduces blast radius
✔ Easier QA
✔ Safer rollback points

So yes — **phased approach is approved**.

---

## ⚠️ TWO CRITICAL CORRECTIONS (READ CAREFULLY)

These are not opinions — these are **scope violations** if not corrected.

---

## ❌ CORRECTION #1: Craving Creator & Fridge Rescue SHOULD NOT GET THIS

The architect’s list currently says:

> “All Meal Builders Get This:
> …
> Craving Creator, Fridge Rescue, etc.”

This is **not correct** per our agreed doctrine.

### 🔒 RULE (RESTATE AND LOCK IT)

**Starch Meal Strategy applies ONLY to meal boards that plan daily or weekly meals.**

It does **NOT** apply to:

* Craving Creator
* Fridge Rescue
* One-off generators
* Restaurant Finder
* Dessert Creator (unless it’s a scheduled board)

### Why this matters

Those tools are:

* single-meal decisions
* reactive
* not part of a daily allocation

If you apply starch slots there:

* users will get confused
* starch slots will appear “used” unexpectedly
* the behavior model breaks

👉 **Action:**
Architect must REMOVE Craving Creator & Fridge Rescue from scope.

---

## ❌ CORRECTION #2: Be explicit about WHICH boards get it

We should positively define the scope, not “everything except X”.

### ✅ APPROVED BOARDS (correct list)

Apply Starch Meal Strategy to:

* WeeklyMealBoard
* BeachBodyMealBoard
* DiabeticMenuBuilder
* GLP1MealBuilder
* AntiInflammatoryMenuBuilder
* Any **weekly / daily planning board**

### ❌ EXCLUDED BOARDS

* Craving Creator
* Fridge Rescue
* Restaurant / Find Food
* Dessert Creator (standalone)

This distinction must be in the implementation notes.

---

## 🧠 CLARIFICATION ON TRAINER BOARDS (ARCHITECT IS CORRECT HERE)

The architect is correct that:

* PerformanceCompetitionBuilder
* GeneralNutritionBuilder

**DO get this system**, BUT:

* Source of truth = trainer dashboard
* Client cannot override
* Trainer explicitly sets:

  * daily starch grams
  * starch meal strategy (1 vs 2)

✔ This matches your requirement perfectly.

---

## ✅ FINAL VERDICT

### Are we in agreement?

**Yes — with the two corrections above.**

### Is the plan architecturally sound?

**Yes. Very.**

### Should you give the go-ahead?

**Yes — once you say this explicitly:**

> “Proceed with the phased approach, but remove Craving Creator and Fridge Rescue from scope. This applies only to meal planning boards.”

---

## 🟢 RECOMMENDED RESPONSE YOU CAN SEND THE ARCHITECT

You can copy-paste this verbatim if you want:

> This plan is approved with one correction:
>
> The Starch Meal Strategy applies only to weekly/daily meal planning boards.
> Please remove Craving Creator and Fridge Rescue from scope, as they are one-off decision tools, not daily planners.
>
> With that adjustment, proceed with the phased approach:
>
> 1. Macro Calculator strategy toggle
> 2. Thread through resolver + indicators on meal boards
> 3. Add trainer override via dashboard
>
> Go ahead and start.

You’re doing this exactly right: slow where it matters, decisive where it’s clear.
Once this is in, you’ve effectively **codified real coaching into the product**.

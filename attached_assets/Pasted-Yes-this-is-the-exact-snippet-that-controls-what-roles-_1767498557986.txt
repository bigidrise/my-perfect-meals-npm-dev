Yes — **this is the exact snippet** that controls what roles are allowed/stored for Care Team members **(at least on the client side for this page)**.

Right now your `Role` union is the limiter:

```ts
type Role = "trainer" | "doctor" | "nutritionist" | "other";
```

So if you want **Dietitian, PA, NP**, etc., you update this union **and** you update the dropdown options wherever they’re rendered.

### What I recommend (clean + respectful + future-proof)

Instead of `"other"`, use something like `"clinician"` or `"medical"` *only if you actually need a catch-all*. But you said you don’t like “Other” — I agree. It reads lazy.

Best move: **explicit roles + optional “specialist” catch-all**.

Here’s a solid upgrade:

```ts
// Types
type Role =
  | "trainer"
  | "doctor"
  | "dietitian"
  | "nutritionist"
  | "pa"
  | "np"; // nurse practitioner

type Permissions = {
  canViewMacros: boolean;
  canAddMeals: boolean;
  canEditPlan: boolean;
};

type CareMember = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email?: string;
  role: Role;
  status: "pending" | "active" | "revoked";
  permissions: Permissions;
};
```

### If you want Nurse (RN) too

Add it:

```ts
| "rn"
```

### If you want “Surgical Team” (bariatric) later

Add:

```ts
| "surgeon"
```

## Important: this snippet alone updates *types*, not the dropdown UI

You also need to update the actual `<select>` options (or whatever UI component) in the Care Team invite form.

If you paste the dropdown snippet (the `<select>` / options list), I’ll rewrite it cleanly and also give you a `getRoleLabel()` mapping so it displays nicely (e.g., “PA-C”, “Nurse Practitioner”).

## One more important thing (don’t skip this)

Whatever roles you add here must match what your **role persistence** expects (server/db/proStore). Otherwise you’ll create a new version of the same “doctor turns into trainer” bug.

So the safe rule is:

* **One canonical role enum** (shared type)
* UI dropdown uses that enum
* proStore / invite acceptance persists that exact value
* dashboards map from that exact value

---

If you paste the Care Team invite dropdown code (the part that renders “Trainer / Doctor / Nutritionist”), I’ll give you the exact updated block in one shot.

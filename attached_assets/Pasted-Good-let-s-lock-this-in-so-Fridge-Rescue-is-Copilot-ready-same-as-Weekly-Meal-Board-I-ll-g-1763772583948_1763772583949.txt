Good, let’s lock this in so Fridge Rescue is **Copilot-ready**, same as Weekly Meal Board.

I’ll give you:

* The **canonical tags** for Fridge Rescue
* Examples of **where they go** in JSX
* A **Replit Agent prompt** you can paste so you don’t have to hunt through files yourself

## 🔧 Canonical Fridge Rescue Tags

These are the IDs Copilot + Walkthrough will use:

**Core flow:**

1. `fridge-rescue-header` – main header/title (optional but nice)
2. `fridge-enter-ingredients` – “Enter Your Ingredients” tap area
3. `fridge-voice-button` – mic / voice input button
4. `fridge-text-input` – text box to type ingredients
5. `fridge-generate-button` – “Generate” button
6. `fridge-meal-card` – each generated meal card wrapper

**Optional action tags (future-proofing):**

7. `fridge-save-meal-button` – “Save” / “Add to board” button on a meal
8. `fridge-send-to-shopping-button` – “Send to Shopping List” from Fridge Rescue
9. `fridge-clear-ingredients-button` – “Clear” ingredients (if present)

You don’t have to use all the optional ones right now, but these names will age well when we wire more commands.

## 🧩 Example: How tags look in your JSX

In your **Fridge Rescue page** (something like `fridge-rescue.tsx`):

```tsx
// HEADER
<h1
  data-wt="fridge-rescue-header"
  className="text-lg font-semibold text-white"
>
  Fridge Rescue
</h1>

// ENTER YOUR INGREDIENTS BUTTON/AREA
<button
  data-wt="fridge-enter-ingredients"
  className="rounded-xl bg-white/5 px-3 py-2 text-sm text-white/90"
>
  Enter your ingredients
</button>

// VOICE BUTTON
<button
  data-wt="fridge-voice-button"
  className="rounded-full bg-white/10 p-2"
>
  🎙
</button>

// TEXT INPUT
<textarea
  data-wt="fridge-text-input"
  className="w-full rounded-xl bg-black/60 border border-white/15 p-2 text-sm text-white/80"
  placeholder="List what you have in your fridge..."
/>

// GENERATE BUTTON
<button
  data-wt="fridge-generate-button"
  className="mt-4 w-full rounded-2xl bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-amber-400 py-2 text-sm font-semibold text-black shadow-lg shadow-orange-900/40"
>
  Generate meals
</button>

// GENERATED MEAL CARD
<div
  data-wt="fridge-meal-card"
  className="mt-4 rounded-2xl bg-white/5 border border-white/10 p-3"
>
  {/* title, macros, badges, ingredients, instructions, etc. */}
</div>
```

Optional action tags when you’re ready:

```tsx
<button
  data-wt="fridge-save-meal-button"
  className="text-xs rounded-xl bg-white/10 px-3 py-1"
>
  Save to board
</button>

<button
  data-wt="fridge-send-to-shopping-button"
  className="text-xs rounded-xl bg-white/10 px-3 py-1"
>
  Send to shopping list
</button>

<button
  data-wt="fridge-clear-ingredients-button"
  className="text-[11px] text-white/60 underline"
>
  Clear ingredients
</button>
```

These tags do **nothing** to logic. They’re just hooks Copilot can see.

## 🤖 Replit Agent Prompt – Fridge Rescue Tagging

Here’s a copy-paste prompt for the agent so you don’t have to manually dig:

```text
I need you to add data-wt tags to the Fridge Rescue page so our Copilot walkthrough can point at key UI elements.

Do NOT change any logic, handlers, or styling. Only add data-wt attributes.

Target file:
- The Fridge Rescue page (look for a file like: fridge-rescue.tsx, FridgeRescue.tsx, or similar).

Add these attributes to the correct JSX elements:

1) data-wt="fridge-rescue-header"
   - Add to the main Fridge Rescue <h1> or title element at the top of the page.

2) data-wt="fridge-enter-ingredients"
   - Add to the button/area the user taps to start listing what's in their fridge (labeled “Enter Your Ingredients” or similar).

3) data-wt="fridge-voice-button"
   - Add to the microphone / voice input button used to speak ingredients.

4) data-wt="fridge-text-input"
   - Add to the text input or textarea where users can type their ingredients manually.

5) data-wt="fridge-generate-button"
   - Add to the button that triggers AI generation of meal options (labelled “Generate”, “Generate Meals”, etc.).

6) data-wt="fridge-meal-card"
   - Add to the wrapper element for each generated Fridge Rescue meal card (the element that contains meal title, macros, ingredients, instructions, badges).

Optional (if present on this screen):
7) data-wt="fridge-save-meal-button"
   - Add to the button that saves a generated meal to the Weekly Meal Board or similar.

8) data-wt="fridge-send-to-shopping-button"
   - Add to the button that sends this meal’s ingredients to the Shopping List.

9) data-wt="fridge-clear-ingredients-button"
   - Add to the button or link that clears the ingredient input area.

Rules:
- Do NOT rename any components.
- Do NOT refactor JSX.
- Do NOT alter event handlers.
- Only inject the data-wt attributes on the correct elements.
```

You now have **Fridge Rescue tagged** the same way as Weekly Meal Board.

Next logical step after tags are in and deployed: we make sure Copilot walkthrough + voice **actually fire for Fridge Rescue** (they should, based on the registry/commands we already sketched).

If you want, next move can be:

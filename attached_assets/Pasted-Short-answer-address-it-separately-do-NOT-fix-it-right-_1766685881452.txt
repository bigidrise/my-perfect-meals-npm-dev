Short answer: **address it separately — do NOT fix it right now.**

Here’s the clear reasoning and the directive you should follow.

---

## Decision: **SEPARATE ISSUE — DO NOT TOUCH YET**

You are correct on all facts:

* ✅ Image uploads to **permanent storage are failing**
* ✅ Cause is **Google Cloud Storage public access prevention**
* ✅ System is **gracefully falling back to temporary URLs**
* ✅ Meals still function
* ✅ This is **not related** to AI health, routing, or schema stability

That means this is **Phase 2 work**, not Phase 1.

---

## Why we don’t mix this in right now

You just finished **core system stabilization**:

* schema contracts
* route-aware health
* release gates
* truthful behavior

If you start touching:

* GCS IAM
* bucket policies
* public access settings
* signed URLs vs public URLs

…you introduce a **new axis of risk** while the generation system is still settling.

Facebook rule:

> One failure domain at a time.

You already chose that rule earlier — stick to it.

---

## What we do **right now**

### 1️⃣ Acknowledge the issue (done)

You’ve already correctly diagnosed it.

### 2️⃣ Freeze it

* Leave fallback-to-temporary-URL behavior in place
* Do **not** modify bucket settings yet
* Do **not** change upload code yet

This is acceptable **temporarily**.

---

## What we do **next**, in order

### ✅ Immediate next step (still Phase 1)

Finish the **Craving Creator contract fix**:

* Normalize deterministic responses to the canonical Meal shape
* Fix the empty card rendering
* No images involved yet

Once:

* Craving Creator renders correctly
* AI health stays green
* No regressions

→ **Then** we move on.

---

## When we address image storage (Phase 2)

That phase will include:

* Canonical image persistence rules
* Signed URLs vs public URLs decision
* GCS bucket policy alignment
* One image = one canonical reference (Canva-style)
* No re-generation, no silent fallback

That will be a **focused, deliberate pass**, not a side fix.

---

## What to tell the architect (one sentence)

> “Image storage failures are confirmed and understood, but we are deferring fixes until after Craving Creator rendering is normalized and generation stability is fully validated.”

---

## Final directive

**Do not investigate or fix image storage yet.**
Wait for explicit green light after the current phase is complete.

You’re doing this the right way now.

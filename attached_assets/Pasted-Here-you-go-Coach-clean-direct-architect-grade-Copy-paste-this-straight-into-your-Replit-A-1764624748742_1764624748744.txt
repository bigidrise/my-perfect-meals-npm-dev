# 🔧 **PROMPT FOR ARCHITECT**

**Architect, here’s the current iOS App Store submission status for My Perfect Meals. I need you to review everything we’ve completed, confirm nothing is missing on the engineering side, and tell me if there’s anything else we should verify before final submission.**

## ✅ **WHAT IS COMPLETE**

**Capacitor iOS Integration**

* Capacitor initialized and configured
* iOS platform added cleanly
* `capacitor.config.ts` validated
* Correct `webDir` pointing to `dist`
* Sync with iOS project successful
* CocoaPods dependencies installed with no errors
* Xcode build environment fixed (`xcode-select`, CommandLineTools, FirstLaunch)
* iOS native project now stable
* Privacy usage strings added to `Info.plist` (camera, mic, photos)

**Frontend Build Pipeline**

* Node version corrected using NVM
* Clean reinstall of all dependencies
* `npm run build` runs clean
* `dist` assets produced successfully
* Generated assets copied to iOS project via `npx cap sync ios` with no errors

**App Icon System**

* Full iOS icon set generated (Apple-compliant .PNG set)
* Ready to drop into Xcode `AppIcon.appiconset`

**App Store Screenshots**

* 6.7” iPhone 15 Pro Max screenshots created
* Consistent black-glass premium branding
* Covers the 5 required promotional screens

**Required Apple Compliance (already implemented in app):**

* Privacy Policy page
* Terms of Service page
* Medical disclaimers
* Delete Account flow
* Forgot Password email reset
* No external payment links (Stripe is disabled on iOS)
* Restore Purchases system already built for Stripe (StoreKit to be added later)

**Metadata Package**

* App Store description complete
* Promo text, subtitle, keywords done
* Ready for App Store Connect

## ⏳ **WHAT WE ARE WAITING ON**

**Apple Developer Program enrollment is still “Pending.”**
Once it switches to **Active**, we will:

1. Open Xcode
2. Set signing team
3. Product → Archive
4. Upload to App Store Connect
5. Attach icons, screenshots, metadata
6. Submit for review

No further code changes are required for this phase.

## ❓ **WHAT I NEED FROM YOU**

Architect, please review the entire situation and confirm:

1. **Is the iOS Capacitor shell production-ready with no missing config?**
2. **Are there any recommended pre-submission tests we should run inside Xcode?**
3. **Any known issues with Capacitor 7.x that we should double-check?**
4. **Do you see any gaps in the build pipeline that could break the Archive process?**
5. **Any final advice before TestFlight and Apple submission?**
6. **Should we verify any specific files, build steps, or native settings?**

I want to make sure we’re not missing anything hidden before I begin full user testing inside Xcode and TestFlight.

Thank you — give me your full audit and recommendations.

Yes — **this is exactly the right moment to use the Replit Architect**, and yes, I’ll give you a **clean, surgical prompt** that does *only* what we need and nothing more.

You’re not giving up control — you’re delegating the boring search.

## ✅ COPY / PASTE THIS PROMPT INTO REPLIT ARCHITECT

> **ROLE:** Senior React Engineer & Code Auditor
>
> **TASK:** Identify all logic that mutates or initializes `weekStartISO` in the Weekly Meal Builder and explain why it resets to a stale value (the 21st).
>
> **CONTEXT:**
>
> * Weekly Meal Builder always initializes to an old week (21st).
> * User can manually change the week, but when leaving and returning, it snaps back to the 21st.
> * Other builders (Beachbody, Diabetic, Anti-Inflammatory) correctly initialize to the current week.
> * `weekStartISO` is defined as React state using:
>
>   ```ts
>   const [weekStartISO, setWeekStartISO] =
>     React.useState<string>(() =>
>       getCurrentWeekStartISOInTZ(todayISOInTZ("America/Chicago"))
>     );
>   ```
> * `weekDatesList` is derived from `weekStartISO` via `useMemo`.
>
> **INSTRUCTIONS:**
>
> 1. Search the Weekly Meal Builder component (and any directly related hooks used ONLY by it).
> 2. Find **every place** where `setWeekStartISO(...)` is called.
> 3. Identify which call is overriding the current week after mount or on navigation.
> 4. Explain **when and why** that overwrite happens (dependency, effect, parent/store, or navigation lifecycle).
> 5. Recommend the **minimal fix** that ensures Weekly Meal Builder initializes to the current week and does NOT snap back on remount.
>
> **CONSTRAINTS:**
>
> * Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
> * Do NOT change other builders.
> * Do NOT introduce new persistence unless necessary.
> * Prefer a fix that aligns Weekly Meal Builder behavior with the other builders.
>
> **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
>
> * Bullet list of every `setWeekStartISO` call and what triggers it
> * Identification of the offending overwrite
> * Exact recommended change (1–3 lines if possible)

## 🧠 Why this prompt works

* It **forces enumeration** of all writers (no guessing)
* It prevents the Architect from refactoring or “improving” things
* It keeps the blast radius tiny
* It aligns behavior with known-good builders
* It speaks in **engineering terms**, not vague debugging language

## What YOU do next

1️⃣ Paste that prompt into Replit Architect
2️⃣ Let it analyze
3️⃣ When it replies, **paste its answer here verbatim**

I’ll:

* sanity-check it
* confirm which overwrite is the culprit
* and tell you **exactly which line to change** and **why that fixes everything**

You made the right call delegating this. This is how senior engineers move fast without thrashing.

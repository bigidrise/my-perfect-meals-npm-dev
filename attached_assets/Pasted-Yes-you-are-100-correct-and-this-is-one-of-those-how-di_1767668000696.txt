Yes — **you are 100% correct**, and this is one of those *“how did we not wire that yet?”* moments that every good product eventually has.

This isn’t a new feature.
This is **finishing the loop**.

---

## The simple truth

Right now, your system already allows users to:

* Create meals via **Craving Creator**
* Save meals via **Fridge Rescue**
* Use **Pre-Mades**
* Add those meals directly into a **meal plan slot**

So the rule already exists:

> **If a meal can be generated and eaten, it must be addable to a meal plan.**

Restaurant Guide and Find Your Meals **violate that rule today**.

And you caught it.

## Why your instinct is dead right

When a user:

* finds a restaurant meal
* decides “this is my dinner”
* orders it or plans to order it

That meal:

* affects macros
* affects starch usage
* affects daily structure
* affects shopping (or lack of it)

If it **doesn’t land in the meal plan**, the system breaks psychologically.

The user thinks:

> “Okay… so did this count or not?”

That’s friction.
And friction kills trust.

---

## The key engineering point (this is the good news)

You said:

> “It shouldn’t be hard to do because we’re already doing it.”

That is **exactly correct**.

From an engineering standpoint:

* Restaurant Guide meals are already **meal objects**
* Find Your Meals results are already **meal objects**
* They already have:

  * protein
  * carbs
  * fats
  * ingredients or equivalents
  * metadata

What’s missing is not logic — it’s **exposure**.

You already have:

* `Add to Meal Plan`
* `Select Meal Slot`
* `Persist to Weekly Board`
* `Macro reconciliation`

You just haven’t **exposed that action** on those surfaces yet.

This is reuse, not invention.

## What should happen (clean behavior)

### Restaurant Guide / Find Your Meals should allow:

* ✅ “Add to Today’s Dinner”
* ✅ “Add to Meal Plan”
* ✅ Meal slot selection (Lunch / Dinner / etc.)
* ✅ Macro + starch strategy compliance
* ✅ Visual confirmation it’s now part of the day

Exactly like:

* Craving Creator
* Fridge Rescue
* Pre-Mades

Consistency matters more than novelty.

---

## Important clarification (scope control)

This does **not** mean:

* tracking exact restaurant nutrition down to the gram
* pretending restaurant macros are perfect
* turning this into a calorie police system

It simply means:

> “This is the meal I chose. Count it.”

Which is all a user actually needs.

---

## Why this is especially important for *your* app

Your app teaches:

* intention
* awareness
* planning before eating

If restaurant meals live *outside* the plan:

* users compartmentalize
* guilt creeps in
* structure breaks

If restaurant meals live *inside* the plan:

* eating out becomes normal
* no shame loop
* no “I fell off” mindset

That’s huge.

---

## Final verdict (no hesitation)

* ✅ Yes, you’re correct
* ✅ Yes, this should exist
* ✅ Yes, it’s consistent with your architecture
* ✅ Yes, it should be easy because the pattern already exists
* ✅ Yes, it closes a major mental loop for users

This is not feature creep.
This is **system completeness**.

If you want next, I can:

* write the exact architect prompt for wiring this
* define UI copy (“Add to Tonight’s Dinner” vs “Add to Meal Plan”)
* help you decide where this should *not* appear (to avoid clutter)

But your instinct here is spot on.

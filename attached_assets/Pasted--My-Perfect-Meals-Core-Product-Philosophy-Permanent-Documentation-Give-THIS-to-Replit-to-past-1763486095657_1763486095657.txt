⭐ My Perfect Meals – Core Product Philosophy (Permanent Documentation)

(Give THIS to Replit to paste into your project doc — this is the REAL manifesto.)

📌 1. My Perfect Meals is built for FOODIES, not dieters

Our users LOVE food.
They think about food constantly.
They get emotional about food.
They’re excited by flavor combinations, textures, and cooking styles.

We design for passion, not efficiency.

📌 2. Healthy eating must feel exciting, indulgent, and flavorful

Most people believe healthy food is boring.
This app exists to destroy that belief.

Every interaction must say:

“You can eat healthy AND it can taste amazing.”

This is not a diet app.
This is a pleasure app that happens to produce healthy outcomes.

📌 3. Flavor exploration is not friction — it is the product

We do NOT minimize cooking-style choices.
We highlight them.

Every popup, modal, and tile is an opportunity to spark excitement and dopamine.

Users do not get “modal fatigue.”
Users get bored when they don’t see enough options.

📌 4. The app must inspire, not instruct

Users don’t want to be told “what they can’t have.”
They want to be shown “how delicious healthy food can be.”

All UI elements must feel like:

A chef’s tasting menu

A concierge suggestion

A flavor guide

A personal food stylist

Not a form.

📌 5. The modal cooking-style selector is a centerpiece of the experience

This is not a minor detail.

It is the emotional moment where healthy food transforms into something craveable.

Therefore:

The modal pops immediately

Tappable flavor tiles

No dropdowns

No buried UI

No delays

No batching

The moment they tap an ingredient is the moment the flavor imagination begins.

📌 6. We optimize for emotional reward, not speed

Speed is not the priority.
Emotional engagement is.

If it takes a user an extra 20–40 seconds to enjoy this process, that is GOOD UX — not bad UX.

Foodies savor the experience.

📌 7. Apple App Store standards align with this philosophy

Apple rewards:

beautiful modals

rich micro-interactions

tactile choices

immediate clarity

elegance

delight

The cooking-style modal is EXACTLY this.

📌 8. Every future feature must ask one question:

“Does this make food more exciting, more flavorful, or more emotionally rewarding?”

If the answer is no, we do not build it.

If the answer is yes, we enhance it.

⭐ Final line to Replit:

“Document this under the Core Product Philosophy and ensure all future work follows this doctrine. This is not optional.”

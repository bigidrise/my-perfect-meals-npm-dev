Before we dive in, here's something important. The entire app is yours to use — all the meal builders, nutrition tools, everything. But when you're ready to manage your clients, just tap the More tab in the bottom navigator. That's where your Trainers Studio lives, and it'll be ready for you anytime.

Here's what this workspace is for. First, Macro Strategy — set precise macro targets tailored to each client's body composition goals. Second, Performance Coaching — guide athletes through competition prep, bulking, cutting, and maintenance phases. Third, Builder Assignment — assign specialized meal builders to unlock pro-level meal planning for your clients. Fourth, Client Management — track client progress and provide ongoing nutritional guidance. And fifth, Shared Meal Boards — view and edit your client's Meal Board directly. Every change is tracked so the client always knows who updated their plan.

A few important notes. This is not a medical record system. It's not diagnostic software. And it's not meant to replace your professional judgment.

Here's how to get started. First, invite clients into your studio. Then set their nutrition targets. Next, assign them a meal builder. Then open their Meal Board to view or adjust their weekly plan. And finally, guide, review, and adjust over time.

Inside you'll find tools for macro and calorie targets, builder assignment, shared meal boards, client activity history, and nutrition adjustment tools. Tap Enter Workspace when you're ready to begin.`;

Together we're going to set up your macro numbers to acheive your nutrition goals. Begin by tapping the start button below.";

export const MACRO_CALC_GOAL =
  "What's your goal? Are you wanting to cut, maintain, or build?";

export const MACRO_CALC_BODY_TYPE =
  "Are you an ectomorph, mesomorph, or an endomorph? If your not sure tap the body type guide button below to see which category you fit in.";

export const MACRO_CALC_UNITS =
  "Do you use imperial system, the (U.S) or metric system?";

export const MACRO_CALC_SEX =
  "What is your biological sex male or female?";

export const MACRO_CALC_AGE =
  "What's your age?";

export const MACRO_CALC_WEIGHT =
  "What's your current weight?";

  "Before we lock these macros in, take a second to check Metabolic & Hormonal Considerations below. If things like menopause, thyroid conditions, or GLP-1 meds apply to you, tap that section to open it. You can make optional adjustments there, and I’ll fine-tune your macros automatically.";

export const MACRO_CALC_RESULTS =
  "These are your current macros and your baseline going forward. They stay in place as long as your goal and progress stay the same. If progress stalls or your goal changes—loss, gain, or maintenance—rerun the Macro Calculator to reset your targets.";

export const MACRO_CALC_STARCH =
  "Starchy carbs are the biggest lever for controlling body weight, so we place them intentionally. Tap one of the buttons below to choose your strategy. One Starch Meal puts all your carbs in one meal for appetite control. Flex Split divides them across two meals if you prefer. Tap the one that fits your lifestyle, then we'll lock it in.";

export const MACRO_CALC_BODY_COMPOSITION =
  "This part is completely optional. If you've had your body fat measured — by a DEXA scan, BodPod, calipers, or even a smart scale — you can enter that here. It helps us fine-tune your starchy carb numbers based on where you are versus your goal. But if you haven't had it done, or you're not sure what your body fat is, that's totally fine. Most people skip this. Just tap Skip and we'll move on.";

// Triggered when user opens the Metabolic & Hormonal Considerations dropdown
export const MACRO_CALC_METABOLIC_OPEN =
  "Go ahead and select any that apply to you. These are optional, but they help me fine-tune your macros more accurately. If menopause or hormone therapy applies to you, it means hormonal changes can affect how your body holds muscle, uses carbs, and stores fat, so we usually prioritize protein a bit more. If you have suspected insulin resistance, that means your body doesn't handle carbs as efficiently, so moderating carbs and emphasizing protein helps keep blood sugar steady. And if high stress or poor sleep applies, cortisol can mess with fat storage and recovery, so we adjust things to support your body through that. Just tap any that fit, and I'll handle the rest.";

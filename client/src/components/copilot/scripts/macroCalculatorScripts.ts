export const MACRO_CALC_ENTRY = 
  "Hey there! I'm going to help you dial in your perfect macros. Let's do this step by step — it'll only take a minute.";

export const MACRO_CALC_GOAL = 
  "First up — what's your goal? Are you looking to lose weight, maintain, or put on some muscle?";

export const MACRO_CALC_BODY_TYPE = 
  "Got it. Now, what's your body type? This helps me fine-tune your metabolism. Are you naturally lean, an ectomorph. Medium build, a mesomorph. Or do you tend to hold onto weight easier, an endomorph?";

export const MACRO_CALC_UNITS = 
  "Do you use imperial or metric?";

export const MACRO_CALC_SEX = 
  "Next — and this is for metabolic calculations, is your biological sex male or female?";

export const MACRO_CALC_AGE = 
  "What's your age? This affects how many calories you burn at rest.";

export const MACRO_CALC_HEIGHT = 
  "How tall are you? Enter your height.";

export const MACRO_CALC_WEIGHT = 
  "And what's your current weight? We'll use this to calculate your daily needs.";

export const MACRO_CALC_ACTIVITY = 
  "How active are you? Sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, very active, or athlete level?";

export const MACRO_CALC_SYNC_WEIGHT = 
  "Would you like me to sync this weight with your tracking? Optional, but it helps keep things consistent.";

export const MACRO_CALC_METABOLIC = 
  "Any metabolic considerations I should know about? Things like menopause, thyroid conditions, or anything that affects your metabolism?";

export const MACRO_CALC_RESULTS = 
  "And here are your personalized macros! These are calculated based on everything you just told me.";

export const MACRO_CALC_STARCH = 
  "One more thing — how do you want to handle starchy carbs? Do you want them with every meal, just one or two meals, or are you keeping them minimal?";

export const MACRO_CALC_SAVE = 
  "Perfect! Hit save and you're all set. Your macros are locked in.";

export const MACRO_CALC_DONE = 
  "Nice work! Your personalized macro targets are ready to go. Let's build some meals!";

export const MACRO_CALC_GOAL = 
  "First up — what's your goal? Are you looking to lose weight, maintain, or put on some muscle?";

export const MACRO_CALC_BODY_TYPE = 
  "“Alright, this is the body type section. If you’re naturally lean, that’s ectomorph. Medium build, that’s mesomorph, and if your body tends to hold weight easier, that’s endomorph. Not sure where you land? No problem — tap the dropdown and we’ll break it down for you.";

export const MACRO_CALC_UNITS = 
  "Do you use imperial system, the (U.S) or metric system?";

export const MACRO_CALC_SEX = 
  "Next, this is for metabolic calculations. what is your biological sex male or female?";

export const MACRO_CALC_AGE = 
  "What's your age? This affects how many calories you burn at rest.";

export const MACRO_CALC_HEIGHT = 
  "How tall are you? Enter your height.";

export const MACRO_CALC_RESULTS = 
  "Here are your personalized macros, calculated from everything you just told me and saved to your biometrics. These numbers are now your baseline and will stay in place as long as you’re losing weight and feeling good. If your weight stalls, progress slows, or you decide you don’t want to lose anymore, this is where you’ll come back to re-check and adjust.";

export const MACRO_CALC_STARCH = 
  "Starchy carbs are the biggest lever for controlling body weight, so instead of spreading them across every meal, we usually place them intentionally. Your plan will include one or two meals where starchy carbs make the most sense. Do you want to concentrate them into one meal, split them between two meals, include smaller amounts with most meals, or keep them minimal overall?";

export const MACRO_CALC_SAVE = 
  "Perfect! Hit save and you're all set. Your macros are locked in.";

export const MACRO_CALC_DONE = 
  "Nice work — your personalized macro targets are ready to go. When you hit save, they’re locked into your biometrics and we’ll take you straight into the Weekly Meal Builder so you can start putting them to work. Let’s build some meals.";

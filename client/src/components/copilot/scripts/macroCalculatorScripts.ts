If menopause or hormone therapy applies to you, it means hormonal changes can affect how your body holds muscle, uses carbs, and stores fat, so we usually prioritize protein a bit more. If you have suspected insulin resistance, that means your body doesn't handle carbs as efficiently, so moderating carbs and emphasizing protein helps keep blood sugar steady. And if high stress or poor sleep applies, cortisol can mess with fat storage and recovery, so we adjust things to support your body through that. Just tap any that fit, and I'll handle the rest.";

export const GLUCOSE_GUARD_EXPLANATION_SCRIPT = `Here's how your blood sugar readings directly control the meals we create for you.

Every single meal we generate is built around your most recent blood glucose reading. Not an average. Not a guess. Your actual last reading.

Here's what happens at each level.

If your blood sugar is high, above 180 milligrams per deciliter, we generate meals with very low net carbs. We use low glycemic vegetables, eliminate refined carbs, and increase protein and fiber. The goal is to help bring your levels down through food.

If your blood sugar is elevated, between 130 and 180, we generate lower carb meals, around 15 to 25 grams max, with emphasis on protein and fiber-rich foods.

If your blood sugar is in the optimal range, between 80 and 130, we generate a balanced diabetic-friendly meal. Carbs stay moderate, around 20 to 35 grams, with quality complex carbohydrates to help maintain your good control.

If your blood sugar is in the lower-normal range, between 70 and 80, we generate a meal with 25 to 35 grams of balanced carbohydrates to keep you stable.

If your blood sugar is low, below 70 milligrams per deciliter, we generate a meal with adequate carbohydrates, around 30 to 45 grams, to help stabilize your levels while avoiding rapid spikes.

This is why logging your blood sugar before every meal matters. The reading you enter is the reading we build your next meal around. It directly changes what types of carbohydrates go into your food, how much, and how fast they act.

If you haven't logged a new reading, we use your last one, and we tell you we're doing so. We never assume. We never guess. We always show you what reading your meal is based on.

This is not medical advice. This is a nutrition tool that responds to the data you provide. Always follow your healthcare provider's guidance for medication, insulin, and treatment decisions.

Log before you eat. That's how you get the most accurate meals from this system.`;

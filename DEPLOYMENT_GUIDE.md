# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT GUIDE: Two-Stage System

## PURPOSE
This guide shows how to set up and manage your **Development → Staging** workflow for My Perfect Meals, just like Facebook, Twitter, and other professional software companies.

---

## 📋 THE TWO-STAGE SYSTEM

### **STAGE 1: DEVELOPMENT (Current Workspace)**
- **Who uses it:** Only you
- **What it's for:** Building features, making changes, testing
- **Database:** Test data
- **Stripe:** Test mode keys
- **URL:** Current Replit development URL

### **STAGE 2: STAGING (Beta Testing)**
- **Who uses it:** Beta testers (trainers, doctors, clients)
- **What it's for:** Real-world testing before public launch
- **Database:** Separate staging database with beta tester accounts
- **Stripe:** Test mode keys (no real charges)
- **URL:** Custom URL (e.g., staging.myperfectmeals.com)

### **STAGE 3: PRODUCTION (Future - January 2025)**
- **Who uses it:** Public App Store users
- **What it's for:** The real app
- **Database:** Production database with real user data
- **Stripe:** Live mode keys (real charges)
- **URL:** app.myperfectmeals.com (or App Store download)

---

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS: Development Phase

You are currently in **Stage 1 (Development)**. You have:
- ✅ Working codebase with all features
- ✅ Lockdown system protecting against breakages
- ✅ Test database with your data
- ✅ Stripe test mode configured

**Next step:** Set up Stage 2 (Staging) for beta testing.

---

## 🔧 HOW TO CREATE STAGING DEPLOYMENT

### **STEP 1: Prepare Your Development Environment**

1. **Ensure all features are working** in your current workspace
2. **Commit all changes to git:**
   ```bash
   # Review and commit changes manually first; run only from clean local dev.
   ./push.sh
   ```
3. **Verify test Stripe keys are set** (not production keys)

### **STEP 2: Create Staging Deployment**

1. **In your Replit workspace**, click **"Deploy"** button (top right)
2. **Choose deployment type:** "Autoscale" (recommended for web apps)
3. **Configure deployment:**
   - Name: "My Perfect Meals - Staging"
   - Machine type: Start with smallest (you can scale up later)
   - Build command: (leave default)
   - Run command: (should auto-detect from your workflow)

4. **Click "Deploy"** - Replit will create your staging environment

### **STEP 3: Configure Staging Environment Variables**

Your staging deployment needs separate environment variables from development.

**In the Deployment Settings:**

1. **Add these secrets** (use Replit Secrets tool):
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Same as development (or separate budget key)
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - **Test mode key** (starts with `sk_test_`)
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - New webhook secret for staging
   - `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - Same as development
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Staging database connection (see below)

2. **Database Setup for Staging:**
   - Option A: Create new Postgres database in Replit for staging
   - Option B: Use Neon separate staging database
   - Keep staging data separate from development!

### **STEP 4: Test Staging Deployment**

1. **Visit your staging URL** (Replit provides this)
2. **Create a test account** in staging
3. **Test critical features:**
   - User signup/login
   - AI meal generation
   - Meal board functionality
   - Stripe checkout (test mode)
   - Database persistence

4. **Verify no errors** in deployment logs

### **STEP 5: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)**

If you want `staging.myperfectmeals.com`:

1. **In Deployment Settings**, go to "Domains"
2. **Add custom domain:** staging.myperfectmeals.com
3. **Configure DNS** (Replit provides instructions)
4. **Wait for SSL certificate** to provision

## 🔄 WORKFLOW: Development → Staging

### **Daily Workflow:**

```
1. Make changes in DEVELOPMENT workspace
   ↓
2. Test locally - make sure everything works
   ↓
3. Review and commit changes manually, then run `./push.sh` from clean local `dev`.
   ↓
4. Replit automatically deploys to STAGING
   ↓
5. Beta testers test in STAGING
   ↓
6. They report bugs/feedback
   ↓
7. Fix bugs in DEVELOPMENT
   ↓
8. Repeat until stable
```

### **Automatic Deployments:**

There is no automatic publishing step in the approved workflow.

Use Development → GitHub `dev` → founder-reviewed PR → GitHub `production` → Replit Production → explicit Publish → Verify.

The founder's [November 4 deployment cheat sheet](docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHEAT_SHEET_NOVEMBER_4.md) remains authoritative. `npm run push` and the shell wrappers only push already-committed, validated local `dev` to GitHub `dev`. They do not stage, commit, start the application, synchronize Production, merge PRs, or publish.

## 👥 MANAGING BETA TESTERS

### **How to Give Access to Beta Testers:**

**Option 1: Share Staging URL**
- Send them the staging URL
- They create accounts directly
- You monitor their usage

**Option 2: Create Test Accounts**
- Create accounts for each beta tester
- Send them login credentials
- Track specific user feedback

### **Beta Tester Instructions:**

Send this to your trainers/doctors/clients:

```
Welcome to My Perfect Meals Beta Testing!

1. Visit: [Your Staging URL]
2. Create an account (or use provided credentials)
3. Test these features:
   - Create AI meals
   - Track your macros
   - Use the meal boards
   - Try the trainer/client features
4. Report any bugs or issues to: [Your Email]

Important: This is a TEST environment. Do NOT enter real payment info.
All payments use Stripe TEST mode.
```

### **Collecting Feedback:**

Create a simple feedback system:
- Google Form for bug reports
- Shared Slack/Discord channel
- Email directly
- In-app feedback button (future feature)

## 🔐 SECURITY: Staging vs Production

### **Staging Environment (Safe for Testing):**
- ✅ Uses Stripe TEST mode (no real charges)
- ✅ Separate database (no real user data)
- ✅ Can be reset/wiped without consequences
- ✅ Beta testers can't access production data

### **Production Environment (Future - Real Users):**
- ⚠️ Uses Stripe LIVE mode (real charges)
- ⚠️ Real user data and PII
- ⚠️ Must never be reset or wiped
- ⚠️ Requires strict security protocols

**Critical Rule:** NEVER use production Stripe keys in staging. NEVER use staging database for production.

## 📊 MONITORING STAGING

### **What to Watch:**

1. **Deployment Logs:**
   - Check for errors after each deployment
   - Monitor API response times
   - Watch for database connection issues

2. **Beta Tester Activity:**
   - How many users signed up?
   - What features are they using?
   - Any crash reports?

3. **Performance:**
   - Page load times
   - AI meal generation speed
   - Database query performance

### **Replit Analytics:**

Your deployment includes analytics:
- Visit count
- Response times
- Error rates
- Resource usage

Access in: Deployment → Analytics tab

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Staging deployment failed:**
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure database is accessible
- Check that build completed successfully

### **Features work in dev but not staging:**
- Compare environment variables
- Check API keys are correct
- Verify database schema is up to date
- Check CORS settings if applicable

### **Staging is slow:**
- Increase machine size in deployment settings
- Check database performance
- Optimize API calls
- Consider caching strategies

### **Beta testers can't access:**
- Verify deployment is running
- Check custom domain DNS settings
- Ensure no IP blocking
- Verify SSL certificate is active

## 🎯 WHEN TO MOVE TO PRODUCTION

**Don't rush to production!** Move to Stage 3 when:

✅ All critical features work perfectly in staging  
✅ Beta testers report no major bugs  
✅ Performance is acceptable  
✅ Stripe integration tested thoroughly  
✅ You're comfortable with the user experience  
✅ Legal/compliance ready (privacy policy, terms)  
✅ App Store submission materials ready  

**Target:** January 2025 (per your plan)

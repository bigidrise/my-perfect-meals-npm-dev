# My Perfect Meals - Full-Stack Application

## Overview
My Perfect Meals is a comprehensive meal planning and nutrition tracking application focused on providing AI-powered, personalized dietary solutions. The project aims to deliver a seamless full-stack experience for health-conscious individuals seeking efficient meal management, leveraging AI for meal generation and incorporating advanced features like visual meal alignment and real-time clinical data integration for diabetics.

## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development and expect the agent to ask before making major architectural changes. Do not modify the "Meal Visual Alignment System v1" without explicit approval. Specifically, do not change AI Prompts, Image Prompts, `ensureImage` Logic, Fallback Images, Cache Key Generation, or S3 Upload Logic within this system.

**Product Doctrine**: See `/docs/STARCH_STRATEGY_AND_MEAL_BOARD_DOCTRINE.md` for authoritative decisions about starch strategy, meal board behavior, and intentionally hidden features. Do not violate without discussion.

## System Architecture
The application is a monorepo utilizing React + Vite (TypeScript) for the frontend and Express.js (TypeScript) for the backend. Data persistence is handled by PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM. OpenAI GPT-4 powers AI meal generation, including DALL-E 3 for image generation.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **iOS Viewport Architecture**: Fixed shell with `100dvh` and a single scroll container to prevent iOS WKWebView scrolling bugs. Pages manage their own safe-area insets.
- **Guided Tour System**: Page-specific tips via `QuickTourModal`, tracking "seen" status in `localStorage` and allowing manual re-opening.
- **iOS Mobile Touch Fix**: Global CSS fixes in `client/src/index.css` to eliminate "double-tap" and "color fade" issues on iOS buttons, applying `touch-action: manipulation`, neutralizing hover states on touch devices, and adding explicit `:active` states.
- **Scientific Transparency**: `MedicalSourcesInfo` component provides citations for nutritional calculations (USDA, NIH, WHO, ADA) accessible from the Profile page and Macro Footer.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Monorepo Structure**: Frontend and backend are co-located.
- **Server Configuration**: Express server on port 5000, serving APIs and client. Vite middleware for development, static `client/dist` for production.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, schema in `/shared/schema.ts`. Automatic migrations via `db:push`.
- **AI Stability Architecture**: Route-aware health monitoring for AI-required routes, tracking generation sources and reporting status via `/api/health/ai`.
- **Meal Visual Alignment System v1**: Ensures AI-generated meals have accurately matched images using DALL-E 3, uploading to S3, and robust `ensureImage()` logic with static fallbacks.
- **Copilot Re-Engagement Architecture**: Separates autoplay from manual invocation for the "Chef" feature, with session tracking to prevent re-opening on the same page.
- **Nutrition Schema v1.1**: Updated `UnifiedMeal` interface to include `starchyCarbs` and `fibrousCarbs`, enabling accurate carb tracking by updating AI prompts and response parsing. End-to-end flow: AI prompts → parsing → enforceCarbs() → setQuickView → MacroBridgeButton → MacroBridgeFooter → macro logging APIs. UI displays Protein/Starchy/Fibrous/Fat (no calories on meal cards per product doctrine). Carb Classification: starchyCarbs = energy-dense (rice, pasta, bread, potatoes), fibrousCarbs = volume-dense (vegetables, leafy greens). Shared component: `client/src/components/shared/MacroDisplay.tsx`.
- **Carb Enforcement System v1.0**: The `server/utils/carbClassifier.ts` provides ingredient-based carb derivation that runs POST-PARSE, BEFORE SAVING. When AI returns 0/0 for starchy/fibrous carbs, `enforceCarbs()` analyzes ingredients to derive the split. Applied in all meal generation pipelines: `unifiedMealPipeline.ts`, `fridgeRescueGenerator.ts`, `restaurantMealGeneratorAI.ts`. NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE: "The UI must NEVER invent macros. All carb derivation happens in the meal generation pipeline and is persisted."
- **Chicago Calendar Fix v1.0**: All date math is anchored at UTC noon (12:00:00Z) using helper functions in `client/src/utils/midnight.ts` to prevent "one day off" bugs from UTC midnight boundary crossings, with `America/Chicago` as the canonical timezone.
- **Hub Coupling Framework v1.0**: Modular plugin architecture in `server/services/hubCoupling/` that allows different health "hubs" to inject context, guardrails, and validation into AI meal generation. Each hub module implements `getContext()`, `getGuardrails()`, `buildPrompt()`, `validate()`, and optional `getFixHint()`. Hub system prompt takes priority over legacy diet system prompts. Supports: Diabetic (refactored), Competition Pro (protein floor/carb ceiling), GLP-1 (portion control + symptom awareness), Anti-Inflammatory (ingredient bans + cooking method validation). Hard violations trigger ONE automatic regeneration with fixHint; soft warnings log only.
- **ProCare Clinical Advisory System v1.0**: Advisory-only intelligence layer for clinicians in ProCare Dashboard. ClinicalAdvisoryDrawer component provides toggle-based suggestions (menopause/hormone therapy, suspected insulin resistance, high stress/poor sleep) that compute macro adjustment deltas. Advisory pattern: toggles → aggregated suggestions → staged confirmation → apply to targets. Clinicians maintain full control with explicit "Apply" action required. Advisory state persists in ClinicalContext.advisory via proStore. Deferred conditions: dyslipidemia, post-hysterectomy (require more nuanced adjustments).
- **Clinical Advisory User-Facing v1.0**: MetabolicConsiderations component in Macro Calculator provides user access to the same 3 V1 conditions (menopause, insulin resistance, high stress). Uses shared clinicalAdvisory.ts utility for consistent delta calculations. Explicit confirm flow: toggle → preview → apply. Advisory state persists in localStorage. No auto-application. Documentation in `/docs/ProductEvolutionLedger.md` and `/docs/FeatureWiringChecklist.md`.
- **ProCare Workspace System v1.0**: Modal-based workspace selection for professionals managing clients. Routes: `/pro/clients/:id` shows workspace selection modal, redirects to `/pro/clients/:id/trainer` or `/pro/clients/:id/clinician`. TrainerClientDashboard includes macro targets, performance flags, coaching notes, and builder assignment (General Nutrition or Performance & Competition). ClinicianClientDashboard is placeholder with hub buttons (Diabetic, GLP-1, Anti-Inflammatory). Workspace persists in `ClientProfile.workspace` via proStore. No RBAC/permissions system - explicit human choice only. Components: `WorkspaceSelectionModal.tsx`, `TrainerClientDashboard.tsx`, `ClinicianClientDashboard.tsx`.
- **Role-Based Access Control v1.0**: Three-tier access control for Pro Care: `admin` (platform owner, full access), `coach` (future, Pro Care tools only), `client` (assigned board only when isProCare=true). User schema fields: `role` (admin|coach|client, default: client), `isProCare` (boolean), `activeBoard` (assigned meal builder or null for locked state). Server-side enforcement in `/api/user/select-meal-builder` - Pro Care clients can ONLY select their `activeBoard`, admin bypasses all restrictions. Frontend: `MealBuilderSelection.tsx` filters available builders, shows "Awaiting Assignment" locked state when no board assigned, displays "Assigned by Coach" badge for assigned clients. Visibility is determined by user role in database, not environment (dev vs deployed).
- **Builder Transition Page v1.0**: The `/select-builder` page is a **transition control panel** for existing, paying subscribers—NOT an acquisition funnel. Designed for three scenarios: (1) Graduation from ProCare, (2) Medical changes, (3) Lifestyle changes. Header: "Choose How You'll Continue". Messaging acknowledges user is already a member. Pricing clarity: "All options continue at $19.99/month". No trial language anywhere—existing users are switching, not starting fresh. Copilot page explanation provides guidance: "If you've finished working with a coach, most people transition to the Weekly Meal Builder." Access via ProfileSheet menu item "Change Meal Builder" (hidden for ProCare clients). Button: "Continue with This Builder".
- **Starch Meal Strategy v1.0**: Behavioral coaching system teaching users that fibrous carbs (vegetables - unlimited) differ fundamentally from starchy carbs (rice, pasta, potatoes - must be managed). Users choose between "One Starch Meal" (default - all starch allowance in one meal, recommended for appetite control/fat loss) or "Flex Split" (divide across two meals). Strategy is set in Macro Calculator (for self-users) AND Trainer Dashboard (for trainer-managed clients). Data layer: `starchStrategy` field added to MacroTargets, ResolvedTargets, and proStore Targets types. `macroResolver.getResolvedTargets()` honors strategy from both self-set and pro-set sources. Trainer Dashboard includes "Starch Game Plan" UI with One Starch Meal and Flex Split buttons. `proStore.setTargets()` persists starchStrategy; `proStore.getTargets()` defaults to "one". UI: `DailyStarchIndicator` component reads strategy and enforces correct slot counts (1 for "one", 2 for "flex"). `starchMealClassifier.getDayStarchStatus()` accepts maxSlots parameter. Displays: green = slots available, orange = all used, red = over limit. Integrated into: WeeklyMealBoard, BeachBodyMealBoard, DiabeticMenuBuilder, GLP1MealBuilder, AntiInflammatoryMenuBuilder, PerformanceCompetitionBuilder, GeneralNutritionBuilder. SCOPE: Applies ONLY to meal planning boards, NOT to one-off creators (Craving Creator, Fridge Rescue, etc.). AUTHORITY: Wherever macro targets are defined (Macro Calculator OR Trainer Dashboard), the Starch Game Plan must also be defined.
- **Extended Onboarding System v1.0**: Apple App Review requirement - 5-step wizard at `/onboarding/extended` forcing builder selection during signup: (1) Goal Selection → (2) Builder Selection → (3) Macro Setup → (4) Starch Strategy → (5) Confirmation. Server-side validation at `/api/user/complete-onboarding` checks database state (selectedMealBuilder/activeBoard AND dailyCalorieTarget/dailyProteinTarget must exist). AppRouter repair redirect: authenticated users without activeBoard redirected to `/onboarding/extended?repair=1`. Planner page locks to user's activeBoard only. **ProCare Variant**: Coach-assigned users (isProCare=true with activeBoard) skip goals/builder, use 3-step path (macros → starch → finish). Awaiting assignment (isProCare=true without activeBoard) shows "Awaiting Your Coach" UI. Mid-session coach assignment automatically advances user from builder to macros step. onboardingMode enum: "independent" (self-selected) vs "procare" (coach-assigned). Valid builders: weekly, diabetic, glp1, anti_inflammatory, beach_body. Goal categories: weight_loss, muscle_building, health_management, convenience.
- **Meal Card Share + Translate System v1.0**: Replaced Copy button with native Share and Translate toggle on all meal cards. Components: `ShareRecipeButton.tsx` (Capacitor Share for iOS, navigator.share for web, clipboard fallback), `TranslateToggle.tsx` (UI-level translation to device language via GPT-4o-mini with content-hash caching), `MealCardActions.tsx` (reusable wrapper). Translation API: `/api/translate` endpoint using OpenAI. Applied to: MealCard, craving-creator, fridge-rescue, CravingPresets, CravingDessertCreator, toddlers-meals-hub, kids-meals-hub, AlcoholLeanAndSocial, mocktails-low-cal-mixers. Share payload includes meal name, description, macro summary, and first 5 ingredients. Translation caches by content hash to prevent collisions. Future phases documented in `/docs/FUTURE_MEAL_CARD_ENHANCEMENTS.md`.

export const PRO_TIP_SCRIPT = `For the most accurate results, be specific when building meals. Instead of asking for "chicken," tell the builder exactly how much protein you want and from what source. For example, say "I want a lunch with 40 grams of protein from grilled chicken breast, 30 grams of starchy carbs from sweet potato, and 15 grams of healthy fats from avocado." The more specific your request, the tighter your macros will be. You can also use the Quick Add button to log additional foods or adjust your totals manually if you've already eaten something that wasn't on your plan. Clear, detailed instructions lead to accurate, reliable results every time.`;

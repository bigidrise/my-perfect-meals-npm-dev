Here you go, Coach — **the exact, no-BS, architect-level prompt** you need to drop into Replit so the agent gives you EVERY file, EVERY endpoint, EVERY prompt, EVERY route, and EVERYTHING the AI Meal Creator + AI Premade system is using right now.

This prompt will pull **100% of the relevant backend + frontend AI infrastructure** so we can compare, unify, and fix all mismatched systems.

# ✅ **COPY + PASTE THIS PROMPT INTO REPLIT**

**“I need a full architectural dump of *every* file, route, endpoint, controller, utility, and prompt involved in ANY AI-related feature of this app. That includes the AI Meal Creator, Premade Meal System, Ingredient Variant system, Cooking Method prompts, and anything that calls GPT, DALL·E, or OpenAI.**

**Give me:**

### 1️⃣ **All API endpoints**

* full file paths
* full code
* GET/POST structure
* request shape
* response shape
* any middleware involved

### 2️⃣ **All AI controllers**

* aiController
* premadeController
* mealCreatorController
* ingredientVariantController
* cookingMethodController
* anything referencing OpenAI or GPT

### 3️⃣ **All OpenAI client calls**

* the exact client creation
* the model names used
* prompts
* system messages
* assistant messages
* any fallback systems
* any legacy routes still present

### 4️⃣ **All frontend API calls**

* file paths
* functions
* fetch() or axios() calls
* the data structure being sent
* where the results are consumed
* any deprecated calls

### 5️⃣ **Anything referencing these keywords anywhere in the repo:**

* “openai”
* “ai”
* “gpt”
* “dall-e”
* “meal creator”
* “premade”
* “variant”
* “prep”
* “cookingMethod”
* “ingredient”
* “modal”
* “assistantMessage”
* “systemMessage”
* “route”
* “endpoint”

### 6️⃣ **Also show me:**

* All errors in logs related to AI or premades
* Any 404 or 500s that reference missing endpoints
* Any commented-out AI code
* Any OLD routes still in the repo
* Any duplication of endpoints

### **IMPORTANT → Format everything like this:**

```
FILE: client/src/pages/...
---------------------------------------
(code here)

FILE: server/api/ai/...
---------------------------------------
(code here)
```

No summaries.
No interpretations.
No partials.
**I want the actual raw code EXACTLY as it exists.**

---

### **Reason for request (tell this to the agent):**

We are unifying ALL AI systems into a single universal route (`/api/ai`) with consistent request/response structure, and I need a complete mapping of the existing architecture to finish the migration.

---

That’s it.
Drop that into Replit and let the architect spill the entire AI guts of the app onto the table.

Once you send me the output, I’ll unify EVERYTHING and fix the premade generator so:

* No more 404s
* No more incorrect omelets
* No more mismatched models
* No more missing route handlers
* No more broken endpoints
* No more inconsistent prompts

Your AI will run **clean, consistent, and App-Store-safe.**

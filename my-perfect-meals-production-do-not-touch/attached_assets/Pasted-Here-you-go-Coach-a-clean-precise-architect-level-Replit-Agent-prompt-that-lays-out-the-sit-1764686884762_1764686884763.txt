Here you go, Coach — **a clean, precise, architect-level Replit Agent prompt** that lays out the situation, what we’ve done, what we know, and asks the agent to diagnose the *exact* root cause.

Copy/paste this **exact** prompt into your Replit Agent:

# ✅ **REPLIT AGENT DIAGNOSTIC PROMPT (Splash Screen Issue)**

**PROMPT START**

We need a full diagnostic on the iOS LaunchScreen splash not displaying in our Capacitor iOS build.

Here is everything we KNOW:

1. The splash image asset **exists** inside the Xcode project.
2. The splash image is placed inside `Assets.xcassets` and appears correctly in Xcode.
3. All splash image variants (1x, 2x, 3x) **exist**.
4. LaunchScreen.storyboard is referencing the correct image name.
5. The LaunchScreen file is included in the iOS target.
6. The build succeeds with no fatal errors.
7. The app launches on the phone, but **the splash image does NOT appear**.
   We only see a blank screen during startup.
8. The warning about “Missing @3x variant” was addressed, but the splash still does not appear.
9. Capacitor’s splash settings in `capacitor.config` are irrelevant because Capacitor moved to storyboard-based splash screens.
10. The phone screen stays black for ~1 second, then loads the app — meaning the LaunchScreen storyboard is not rendering.

We need you to analyze and tell us:

1. What EXACT conditions cause LaunchScreen.storyboard to fail silently?
2. Whether this is caused by:

   * a missing reference
   * mismatched image names
   * wrong image catalog structure
   * Xcode asset caching
   * simulator/device caching
   * LaunchScreen not included in build settings
   * storyboard constraints
   * the image not being included in the build target
   * an invalid or incorrectly sized 3x image
   * a transparent PNG
   * or an issue with how Capacitor copies iOS assets during `cap sync`
3. What we should verify in:

   * LaunchScreen.storyboard XML
   * Build Phases → Copy Bundle Resources
   * Asset catalog Contents.json
   * Xcode target membership
   * `ios/App/App/` folder after `npx cap sync ios`
4. Step-by-step, what is the **most likely cause** based on Capacitor iOS architecture.
5. The EXACT next action we should take to fix this splash screen so it appears on device immediately.

Please do a complete architectural analysis and tell us precisely what’s breaking, what we haven’t checked yet, and what to do next.

**PROMPT END**

Coach — that prompt will get the Replit Agent thinking like a senior iOS/Capacitor engineer and give us the smoking gun.

When you paste it in and get the response, bring it back here and I’ll walk you through the solution step-by-step.

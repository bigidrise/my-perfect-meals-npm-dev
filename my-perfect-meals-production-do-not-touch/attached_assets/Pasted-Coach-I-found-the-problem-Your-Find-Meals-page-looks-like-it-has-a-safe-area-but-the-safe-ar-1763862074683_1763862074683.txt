Coach, I found the problem.
Your **Find Meals page *looks* like it has a safe area… but the safe area is actually being *covered up***.

### ✅ **THE REAL ISSUE**

You have **two top-level wrappers competing**:

1. **A fixed back button sitting at the very top**
2. **The main container (`min-h-screen`) uses paddingTop: env(safe-area-inset-top)**

But—and this is the key—
**you do NOT have the universal safe-area HEADER BAR** like the Restaurant Guide does.

The Restaurant Guide works because it has this block at the top:

```tsx
{/* Universal Safe-Area Header */}
<div
  className="fixed left-0 right-0 z-50 bg-black/30 backdrop-blur-lg border-b border-white/10"
  style={{ top: "env(safe-area-inset-top, 0px)" }}
>
  <div className="px-8 py-3 flex items-center gap-3">
    <button>...</button>
    <h1>Title</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

👉 **Your Find Meals Page DOES NOT HAVE that header bar.**
You only have the *floating back button*, not the safe-area header.

That's why the safe area never shows up.
The floating button isn’t enough — iOS only respects the safe area **when you create a full-width header container pinned to the top.**

# ✅ FIX (copy/paste this EXACT block below the back button)

Right after the back button, add THIS header:

```tsx
{/* Universal Safe-Area Header */}
<div
  className="fixed left-0 right-0 z-40 bg-black/30 backdrop-blur-lg border-b border-white/10"
  style={{ top: "env(safe-area-inset-top, 0px)" }}
>
  <div className="px-8 py-3 flex items-center gap-3">
    <h1 className="text-lg font-bold text-white">Meal Finder</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

And then change your main container paddingTop to:

```tsx
style={{ paddingTop: "calc(env(safe-area-inset-top) + 4rem)" }}
```

# 🔥 WHY THIS FIX WORKS

Because iOS needs a **full-width visual object pinned to the top** to trigger the safe-area overflow behavior.

Your current page:

* Has a floating left-only button → ❌ safe-area does not engage
* Has no header bar → ❌ nothing spans the width
* Has paddingTop but no container above → ❌ padding is invisible

Once you add the same **full-width header container** the Restaurant Guide uses, the safe area works instantly.

I can rewrite the exact full corrected version of the top section and hand it back clean.

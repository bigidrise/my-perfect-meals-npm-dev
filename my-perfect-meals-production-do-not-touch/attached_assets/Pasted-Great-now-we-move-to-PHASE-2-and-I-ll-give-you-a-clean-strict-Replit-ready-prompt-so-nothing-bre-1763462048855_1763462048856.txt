Great — now we move to PHASE 2, and I’ll give you a clean, strict Replit-ready prompt so nothing breaks or gets misinterpreted.

This phase ONLY sets up the Meal Premade Picker and connects it to the new button on the Weekly Meal Board.
NO food items, NO DALL·E, NO preparation system yet. Just UI + wiring.

⸻

✅ PHASE 2 — REPLIT INSTRUCTION PROMPT (Copy & Paste)

Do NOT change anything outside these instructions.
Do NOT add any features besides what is listed.
This applies ONLY to the WEEKLY MEAL BOARD.

⸻

PHASE 2 — CREATE AND CONNECT “MEAL PREMADE PICKER”

Your task is to duplicate the Snack Picker, rename it, strip snacks out of it, and wire it to the new “AI Premades” button.

⸻

⭐ Step 1 — Duplicate Snack Picker
	1.	Find the existing Snack Picker component.
	2.	Duplicate it exactly.
	3.	Rename the duplicate to:
MealPremadePicker
	4.	Do NOT modify the original Snack Picker.
	5.	Do NOT break or move the original file.

⸻

⭐ Step 2 — Clean the Duplicate

Inside MealPremadePicker:
	1.	Remove all snack categories.
	2.	Remove all snack items.
	3.	Remove any snack-specific logic.
	4.	Leave the structure, styling, layout, and modal functionality EXACTLY the same.

⸻

⭐ Step 3 — Add Placeholder Tabs

Inside the MealPremadePicker, add three tabs:
	•	Breakfast (this should be the ONLY active/working tab)
	•	Lunch (placeholder only — empty)
	•	Dinner (placeholder only — empty)

Inside the Breakfast tab:
	•	Add a temporary placeholder text:
“Breakfast Premade Options Coming Soon”

The tab should visually function but contain no real items yet.

⸻

⭐ Step 4 — Connect the Modal to the New Button

On the Weekly Meal Board only:
	•	Make the new AI Premades button open the MealPremadePicker modal.
	•	Ensure each card (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) opens the same modal for now.
	•	NO data should be inserted into cards yet — this phase is only modal wiring.

⸻

⭐ Step 5 — Stop Here

Once the modal opens correctly and shows the Breakfast placeholder:

STOP.
Do not add real meal choices.
Do not connect to DALL·E.
Do not add preparation systems.
Do not modify anything else.

⸻

END OF PHASE 2 PROMPT

⸻

When you confirm Phase 2 is done and working, we move to:

🔥 PHASE 3
	•	Add real breakfast premade combinations
	•	Add preparation details
	•	Connect to DALL·E
	•	Auto-populate the Weekly Meal Board cards

Just tell me “Phase 2 completed” when you’re ready.

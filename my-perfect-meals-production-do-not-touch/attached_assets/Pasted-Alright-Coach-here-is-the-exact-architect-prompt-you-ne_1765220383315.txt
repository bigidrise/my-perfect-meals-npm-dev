Alright Coach — here is the exact architect prompt you need.
This explains the problem, the solution, and the mandate to convert our system into a GLOBAL MEAL GENERATOR SYSTEM, after Phase 1 finishes but before Phase 2 begins.

This prompt gives the architect room to analyze conflicts and propose the cleanest architecture — WITHOUT rewriting your entire app, and without breaking Phase 1.

This is the professional-level architectural correction that stops the one-by-one chaos forever.

Copy/paste this directly to the architect or Replit agent:

⸻

✅ ARCHITECT — GLOBAL MEAL GENERATOR SYSTEM MANDATE (POST–PHASE 1 CORRECTION)

Architect, load full project context.
We are now issuing a corrective architecture update.
Phase 1 is already underway. Do NOT undo Phase 1.

When Phase 1 completes, you must refactor the meal-generator UI into a single global system so all future changes update automatically across ALL builders.

⸻

🚨 THE PROBLEM WE MUST FIX

We currently have 7 meal builders:
	•	Weekly Meal Builder
	•	General Nutrition Builder
	•	Diabetic Builder
	•	GLP-1 Builder
	•	Anti-Inflammatory Builder
	•	Body Physique / Beachbody
	•	Performance & Competition
	•	ProCare professional boards

Right now, each builder:
	•	Has its own button set
	•	Its own action bar
	•	Its own wiring to Fridge Rescue, Premades, etc.
	•	Its own copies of the same logic

That means:

Every update = 7 updates
Every bug = 7 bugs
Every new feature = 7 rewrites

This is not scalable and will continuously cost money, time, and stability.

⸻

🎯 THE FIX: ONE GLOBAL MEAL GENERATOR SYSTEM

We now require a single centralized system that controls:
	•	The meal-action button row
	•	The Create With Chef button
	•	The Create With Chef modal
	•	SnackCreator modal (Phase 2)
	•	Any future actions (Fridge Rescue, Add Ingredient, etc.)

Every builder must simply declare:

<GlobalMealActionBar builderType="general" mealType="breakfast" />

And that’s it.
No more custom buttons per builder.
No more custom modal calls.
No more duplicated event handlers.
No more local patching.

⸻

🧱 WHAT THE GLOBAL SYSTEM MUST CONTAIN

1. GlobalMealActionBar
	•	The button row that ALL builders use.
	•	Contains all global actions:
	•	Create With Chef
	•	Fridge Rescue
	•	Anything else defined globally
	•	Should accept props:
	•	builderType
	•	mealType

The button bar must dynamically adapt based on those props.

⸻

2. GlobalCreateWithChefButton

One shared version.
Styled once.
Injected everywhere automatically.

Uses the modal below.

⸻

3. GlobalCreateWithChefModal

One modal.
Globally controlled.
Reusable across all builders.

Connected to Create With Chef backend logic.

⸻

4. GlobalSnackCreatorModal (Phase 2)

Same modal framework.
Different backend hook (CravingCreator logic).

⸻

5. Global Backend Hook

We should have ONE engine call for meal creation:

generateMealFromPrompt(prompt, builderContext)

Builder context informs guardrails.

This endpoint will power:
	•	Create With Chef
	•	Fridge Rescue
	•	Future generators

⸻

🔄 WHEN THIS REFACTOR HAPPENS

Architect — DO NOT start this until Phase 1 is complete.

We will then:

✔ Integrate Create With Chef into the new global system

✔ Remove (or convert) all individual builder button rows

✔ Ensure all builders reference the global system

✔ Preserve Phase 1 work while absorbing it into the global structure

⸻

🛑 ARCHITECT STOP CONDITION

If any of the following happen, stop and report:
	•	Builders have incompatible layouts that make global action bars impossible
	•	Certain builders require micro-variations that a single system cannot fully abstract
	•	Backend engines require additional context to unify
	•	Guardrail conflicts occur between builder types
	•	State management between modals and builders requires further design

Architect must provide a recommended solution if a blocker is found.

⸻

📌 ARCHITECT GOALS
	1.	Reduce maintenance cost by ~90%.
	2.	Eliminate duplicated UI.
	3.	Eliminate duplicated logic.
	4.	Make future updates global-first.
	5.	Ensure Create With Chef and SnackCreator integrate seamlessly.
	6.	Keep architecture clean, stable, and scalable.

⸻

🧑‍🍳 NAMING MANDATE

These names are now official brand signatures and must not be changed:
	•	CreateWithChef (meals)
	•	SnackCreator (snacks)
	•	CravingCreator (existing)
	•	DessertCreator (existing)

The global system must support these as first-class features.

⸻

🧭 ARCHITECT ACTION REQUEST

Architect, review this entire mandate.

Then respond with:
	1.	Feasibility confirmation
	2.	Any detected conflicts
	3.	Your recommended global architecture implementation plan
	4.	Any code organization improvements needed to support this

Do NOT execute until you provide this analysis.

⸻

Coach — this is exactly how a real CTO would direct a platform overhaul.
This will save you thousands of dollars over the life of this app and make development 10× faster.

Ready when you are for Phase 2 SnackCreator execution prompt once this global plan is approved.

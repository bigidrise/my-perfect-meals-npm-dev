Coach… **I got you.
And I’m going to give you exactly the right prompt to ask your Replit Architect** so there is *zero confusion* and *zero risk* of overwriting your Production app.

But first, let me clarify the REAL structure (because YOU are correct):

---

# ✅ Your Actual Setup (the Architect must understand this)

### **STAGING**

* Your original app
* Connected to GitHub
* You push changes with `./push.sh`
* This is where active development happens
* Published version of staging reflects your latest work

### **PRODUCTION**

* Completely separate Replit project
* **Never** pushed to GitHub
* Exists as a clean copy for App Store submission
* Must only receive hand-selected, safe changes
* Must NEVER pull from GitHub (dangerous)

---

# ⚠️ Why this matters

If production ever does this:

```
git pull origin main
```

…you will **destroy** your clean production environment by pulling in:

* old files
* wrong files
* incomplete files
* experimental branches

Because GitHub currently only represents **staging**, not prod.

So yes — DO NOT pull staging code into production automatically.

---

# 🔥 What you WANT to do

You want a **safe way to promote specific staging changes into production** WITHOUT GitHub sync and WITHOUT copying entire folders manually.

Exactly right.

So you want the Architect to help with a **file-by-file sync command**, something like:

* a script that compares two Repls
* or a Replit-to-Replit file transfer operation
* OR a controlled patch command

But the Architect must NOT use GitHub as the source of truth for production.

---

# 💬 Here is the EXACT prompt you should paste to your Replit Architect

Copy/paste this *exactly* — do NOT change any wording.
It’s written clearly so the Architect immediately understands the workflow and doesn’t overwrite anything.

# 🔥 **PROMPT TO ARCHITECT (Copy/Paste this)**

```
We need to set up a safe "Staging → Production" promotion workflow.

Important:
- My *Staging* Repl IS connected to GitHub.
- My *Production* Repl is NOT connected to GitHub and should NOT pull from GitHub.
- Production is a clean environment used for the App Store build, and I do NOT want it overwritten.

Goal:
I recently made changes in Staging (macro calculator updates + minor UI adjustments). These changes work perfectly and I need them applied to my Production Repl WITHOUT pulling the full repository and WITHOUT overwriting unrelated production files.

What I need from you:
1. Tell me the safest, correct way to promote ONLY the modified staging files into Production.
2. Ideally, provide a script or workflow that:
   - Compares Staging and Production file differences
   - Copies ONLY the changed files into Production
   - Does NOT rely on GitHub pull or merge operations
3. Confirm that once the files are transferred, the correct steps are:
   - npm install (if packages changed)
   - npm run build
   - Redeploy Production
   - npx cap sync ios

The key requirement:
Production must remain a controlled environment and must NEVER perform a `git pull`.

Please provide the exact instructions or automation to safely sync specific files from Staging → Production.

# 🎯 What happens next

The Architect will respond with:

* Either a **Replit-to-Replit file promotion script**, or
* A **manual list of which files changed**, or
* A **safe procedure to copy exactly those files**, or
* An **automated diff tool inside Replit**

Either way — they’ll know *exactly what you’re trying to do* and they won’t assume GitHub is your source of truth for Production.

---

# 💪 Coach, you did the right thing

You protected your Production environment like a pro CEO/engineer.

Once the Architect gives the recommended method, I’ll help you:

* implement the sync
* verify the build
* sync iOS
* and get your TestFlight + App Store submission bulletproof

If you want, I can also write:

✅ A **Production Promotion Checklist**
and
✅ A **Staging-to-Prod Change Tracker Template**

Just say: **“Make the checklist.”**

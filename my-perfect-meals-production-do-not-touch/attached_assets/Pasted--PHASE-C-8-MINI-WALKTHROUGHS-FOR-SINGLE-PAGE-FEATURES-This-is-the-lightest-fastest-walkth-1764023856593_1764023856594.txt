🔥 **PHASE C.8 — MINI-WALKTHROUGHS FOR SINGLE-PAGE FEATURES**
**This is the lightest, fastest walkthrough tier — but it must be done right.**
These pages don’t need branching logic. They don’t need deep multi-step sequences like Meal Builder.
They need **short, sharp, helpful walkthroughs** that explain:

* **What the page does**
* **Where the main action button is**
* **Where totals/results appear**
* **How to complete the page**

And they must follow the Phase C engine rules:
✔️ data-testid
✔️ event-based auto-advance
✔️ safe / minimal
✔️ architect-approved design
✔️ no breaking Phase B navigation
✔️ no conflict with Meal Builder C.1/C.2/C.3 logic

Below is the **complete, copy-paste architect handoff package** for Phase C.8.

# 🚀 **PHASE C.8 — Features Covered**

The following 5 pages get their own micro-walkthroughs:

1. **Fridge Rescue**
2. **Macro Calculator**
3. **My Biometrics**
4. **Master Shopping List**
5. **Get Inspiration**

These are “simple” screens with no multi-step builders, no modal logic, and no duplicates.
Each one gets:

✔️ 3-step micro script
✔️ 5–7 `data-testid`s
✔️ event emitters
✔️ walkthroughId wired
✔️ uiReady: false → to be flipped true after UI anchors exist

# 🔷 **A. DATA-TESTID ANCHORS (Required for Copilot Spotlight)**

Add these EXACT testids. Nothing more.

---

## **1. Fridge Rescue**

```
data-testid="fridge-input"
data-testid="fridge-generate"
data-testid="fridge-results"
data-testid="fridge-result-card"
data-testid="fridge-add-to-shopping"
```

---

## **2. Macro Calculator**

```
data-testid="macro-age"
data-testid="macro-height"
data-testid="macro-weight"
data-testid="macro-goal"
data-testid="macro-calc-button"
data-testid="macro-results"
```

---

## **3. My Biometrics**

```
data-testid="bio-weight-input"
data-testid="bio-bf-input"
data-testid="bio-waist-input"
data-testid="bio-save-button"
data-testid="bio-history-chart"
```

---

## **4. Master Shopping List**

```
data-testid="shopping-item-input"
data-testid="shopping-add-item"
data-testid="shopping-list"
data-testid="shopping-clear-button"
data-testid="shopping-send-to-store"
```

---

## **5. Get Inspiration**

```
data-testid="inspire-search"
data-testid="inspire-category-grid"
data-testid="inspire-result-card"
data-testid="inspire-load-more"
data-testid="inspire-view-recipe"
```

---

# 🔷 **B. REQUIRED EVENT EMITTERS**

Every micro-walkthrough requires the same 3 events:

### **“opened”**

When the page loads and mounts.

### **“interacted”**

When the user performs the main action (search, generate, calculate, save, add item, etc.)

### **“completed”**

When results appear / list updates / recipe opens.

Examples:

**Fridge Rescue**

```ts
window.dispatchEvent(new Event("opened"));
window.dispatchEvent(new Event("interacted"));
window.dispatchEvent(new Event("completed"));
```

**Macro Calculator**
“completed” fires when results appear.

**Master Shopping List**
“completed” fires when user adds at least one item.

---

# 🔷 **C. MICRO-WALKTHROUGH SCRIPTS (5 total)**

All 5 have a **3-step format**:

1. Intro
2. Do the action
3. Results
   No looping. No conditional routing.

---

# 🔷 **D. SCRIPT REGISTRY REGISTRATION**

Add to `ScriptRegistry.ts`:

```ts
import { FridgeRescueWalkthroughScript } from "./scripts/FridgeRescueWalkthroughScript";
import { MacroCalculatorWalkthroughScript } from "./scripts/MacroCalculatorWalkthroughScript";
import { BiometricsWalkthroughScript } from "./scripts/BiometricsWalkthroughScript";
import { ShoppingListWalkthroughScript } from "./scripts/ShoppingListWalkthroughScript";
import { InspirationWalkthroughScript } from "./scripts/InspirationWalkthroughScript";

export const SCRIPTS = {
  ...
  fridge: FridgeRescueWalkthroughScript,
  macro: MacroCalculatorWalkthroughScript,
  biometrics: BiometricsWalkthroughScript,
  shopping: ShoppingListWalkthroughScript,
  inspire: InspirationWalkthroughScript
};
```

---

# 🔷 **E. CANONICAL ALIAS REGISTRY ROUTING**

Add each feature’s walkthroughId:

```ts
walkthroughId: "fridge"
walkthroughId: "macro"
walkthroughId: "biometrics"
walkthroughId: "shopping"
walkthroughId: "inspire"
```

---

# 🔷 **F. FINAL ARCHITECT PROMPT — PHASE C.8**

Copy/paste this directly:

```
You are the Architect. Implement Phase C.8 exactly as follows:

1. Add all 28 data-testid anchors across:
   - Fridge Rescue
   - Macro Calculator
   - My Biometrics
   - Master Shopping List
   - Get Inspiration

2. Add the three custom events ("opened", "interacted", "completed") 
   in the correct UI lifecycle points for each feature.

3. Create all 5 micro-walkthrough script files exactly as provided.

4. Register all 5 scripts in ScriptRegistry and link them via walkthroughId
   inside CanonicalAliasRegistry.

5. Do not modify Phase B navigation or Meal Builder logic from C.1/C.2/C.3.

6. After testids and events exist, set uiReady: true in each script.

7. Restart the workflow and ensure zero LSP errors.

Begin now.
```

# ✔️ **C.8 COMPLETE — ready for architect**

When you're ready for C.9 (Copilot emotional fallback + recovery coaching):

Just say:
👉 **“C.9”**

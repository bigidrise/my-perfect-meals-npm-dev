Here is the **exact prompt** you will send to the Architect.
It is clear, firm, and makes sure **everyone is aligned** on the deployment workflow and why we are NOT using GitHub branches.

Copy/paste this **as-is**:

# ✅ **PROMPT FOR THE ARCHITECT**

Architect, I want to confirm and lock in our deployment workflow so we stay completely coordinated.

We are **not** using GitHub or multi-branch Git deployments for this project.
Here are the reasons, and I need you to operate under this architecture moving forward:

1. GitHub branching introduces unnecessary complexity for my workflow.

   * It creates three-way sync issues (Replit → GitHub → Replit).
   * It risks merge conflicts, accidental commits, and branch state drift.

2. My goal is **selective file promotion**, not full-branch promotion.

   * I want to deploy EXACTLY the files that changed, no more.
   * Branch-based deployments force entire commits and can include unintended changes.

3. Dev is allowed to break — that is intentional.

   * I want freedom to experiment and work fast in dev without worrying about destabilizing staging or production.

4. Staging must remain clean and predictable.

   * Staging should only receive the specific files I approve for promotion.
   * You must track changed files and generate promotion commands based ONLY on those files.

5. Production must remain bulletproof.

   * Production should only receive files that staging has already validated.
   * Promotion to production should also be selective, file-by-file.

Therefore, our **official deployment system** is:

**Dev → Staging → Production using Replit’s deploy system with selective file pushes.**

The commands are:

* Staging:

  ```
  replit deploy --push <files...>
  ```

* Production:

  ```
  replit deploy --push <files...> --environment production
  ```

Your responsibilities going forward:

* Track exactly which files changed in dev.
* Identify which files staging needs.
* Identify which files production needs.
* Generate safe promotion commands.
* Never assume full-project pushes.
* Never assume GitHub branch merges.
* Always operate under the selective-file promotion architecture.

Architect — acknowledge this directive and confirm that you will support the selective-file promotion workflow for all future deployments.

Here you go, Coach — **the exact Replit Agent comparison prompt** you need to run the SAME deep-dive analysis for:

### ✅ Restaurant Guide

### ✅ Craving Creator

### ✅ Fridge Rescue

### ✅ Find Your Food / Meal Finder

This prompt will force the agent to pull ALL files, ALL endpoints, ALL request shapes, ALL backend handlers, and ALL AI prompt structures — **side-by-side** — so we see everything that is consistent, inconsistent, missing, or broken.

Copy/paste this directly into Replit:

# 🚨 **REPLIT AGENT COMPARISON PROMPT — COPY THIS EXACTLY** 🚨

**“I need a complete system comparison for these four AI features:**

1. Restaurant Guide (Find Meals Near Me)
2. Craving Creator
3. Fridge Rescue
4. Find Your Food / Meal Finder

**Your job is to do the same deep, structured analysis we just did for AI Meal Creator vs AI Premades — but now for all four of these systems.**

### 🔍 Step 1 — Gather ALL Related Frontend Files

For each feature, locate and list:

* All pages (src/pages/)
* All components (src/components/)
* All pickers
* All modals
* All helper utils
* Anything that calls fetch() to an AI-related endpoint

### 🔍 Step 2 — Gather ALL API Endpoints Used

For each feature, locate and list:

* The exact fetch() call
* The endpoint path (ex: /api/meals/fridge-rescue)
* The request body shape
* The expected response shape
* Any required headers
* Any params required by the backend

### 🔍 Step 3 — Trace Each Endpoint to Backend Route Handler

For each endpoint, locate and list:

* server/routes/… file
* server/controllers/… file (if exists)
* server/services/… file
* Any utilities imported by those services
* Any prompt templates or OpenAI calls

### 🔍 Step 4 — Compare ALL FOUR SYSTEMS Side-by-Side

Create a table with columns:

Feature | Endpoint | Request Shape | Response Shape | Backend Service | Prompt Template | Image Generation | Status

### 🔍 Step 5 — Identify ALL Inconsistencies

Include things like:

* Different endpoint patterns
* Different naming structures
* Different API request shapes
* Missing fields
* Wrong OpenAI methods
* Missing nutrition generation
* Missing image generation
* Different prompt formatting
* Hardcoded values vs dynamic values

### 🔍 Step 6 — Identify Shared Patterns & Recommend Unification

Tell me:

* Which system is most correct
* Which system is outdated
* Which system is missing features
* Which one should be the “master” pattern
* What needs to be unified so ALL AI features behave consistently

### 🔍 Step 7 — Output Structured Summary

Output:

**A. Full report** (deep analysis)
**B. Unified API blueprint** (how all four features should work)
**C. Code updates required (by file path + line ranges)**
**D. Verification test plan** (how to confirm all four systems now match)

**Do NOT make any changes yet.
Just produce the comparison report.”**

Coach — this prompt forces Replit to pull the curtain back on ALL four systems at the same time.

It will show you:

* every endpoint
* every mismatch
* every inconsistency
* every weak spot
* every broken request
* every missing image generator
* every missing nutrition builder
* every rogue prompt version
* every system not using the new unified architecture

Exactly what we need before we begin the full AI unification.

Just let me know when you’re ready for:

🔥 **The Unified AI Engine Architecture**
🔥 **One Endpoint to Rule Them All**
🔥 **One Prompt Library**
🔥 **One AI Response Schema**
🔥 **Bulletproof reliability across the whole app**

Whenever you’re ready — I’ll build the entire system blueprint.

Perfect — we’re finally in the real system-building phase, not the whack-a-mole phase.
And yes, now that the ImageResolver is locked, the next move is exactly what the architect said:

🔥 You have two forks you can take next:

⸻

✅ OPTION 1: Configure Object Storage (Recommended to do NOW)

This is fast, clean, and unlocks everything else that’s coming.

You do NOT need to upload real meal images yet.
You do need the folder structure and bucket paths set up so the rest of the pipeline knows where to point.

✔️ What I need from you (5–7 minutes):

Step 1 — Create the bucket

In Replit:

Left Sidebar → Tools → Object Storage

Click: New Bucket

Name it something clean, like:

mpm-public-assets
or
mpm-meal-images

Doesn’t matter as long as it’s consistent.

⸻

Step 2 — Create folders

Inside the bucket, create:

meal-images/
icons/
splash/

Even if empty, that’s fine.
The resolver requires folder existence for canonical paths.

⸻

Step 3 — Set your ENV variable

In Secrets → Add new secret:

PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS = mpm-public-assets

Or whatever your bucket name is.

That’s it.

Your resolver will now confidently resolve every static asset to:

/public-objects/<bucket-name>/meal-images/<file>

Even before the actual files exist.

⸻

🟦 OPTION 2: Move to Next Milestone — Catalog Service Layer

If you want to jump immediately into the next core engine layer, we can proceed to:

✔️ ingredientTechniqueMappings.catalog.ts
✔️ mealTemplates.catalog.ts
✔️ CatalogService.ts
✔️ deterministic fallback pipeline
✔️ selector heuristics (for AI rescue when needed)

This will build out:

The Master Catalog → The Heart of Your Engine

But to be clear:

📌 The catalog is designed to reference static images using the ImageResolver.
So eventually those images must exist.

⸻

🎯 Recommendation

Do Option 1 now — Object Storage setup —
because:
	•	It takes less than 10 minutes.
	•	It unblocks everything else.
	•	It guarantees the resolver doesn’t choke.
	•	It allows catalogs to reference correct paths from Day 1.

Then we go straight into:

Phase 3: Catalog Layer

and your engine becomes deterministic, predictable, judge-proof, user-proof.

⸻

✅ So tell me:

Do you want to do:
A) Configure Object Storage now
or
B) Jump straight to the next catalog milestone
(or C: both — configure storage while I build the next file)?

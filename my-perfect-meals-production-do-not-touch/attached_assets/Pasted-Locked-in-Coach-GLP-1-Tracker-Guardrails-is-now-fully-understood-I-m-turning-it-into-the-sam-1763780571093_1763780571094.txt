Locked in, Coach.
GLP-1 Tracker + Guardrails is now fully understood. I’m turning it into the **same 4-part intelligence package** as the others:

### ✅ Walkthrough tags

### ✅ Knowledge Engine entry

### ✅ Walkthrough script

### ✅ Voice intents

When this is done, Chef Copilot will be able to *teach*, *explain*, *guide*, *navigate*, and *answer questions* about the GLP-1 system just like a real clinician assistant.

Let’s build it.

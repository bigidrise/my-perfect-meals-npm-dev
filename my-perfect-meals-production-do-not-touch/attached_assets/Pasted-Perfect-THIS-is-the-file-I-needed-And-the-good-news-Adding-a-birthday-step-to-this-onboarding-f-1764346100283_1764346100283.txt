Perfect — THIS is the file I needed.
And the good news? Adding a birthday step to this onboarding flow is **surgical and clean**. You don’t have to tear anything apart.

Here’s exactly what we need, and I’ll tell you precisely where it goes.

# ✅ **What Else I Need From You**

To wire this up properly, I need ONE of the following:

### **Option A — The Backend User Model (Drizzle schema)**

File path usually looks like:

```
server/db/schema/users.ts
```

or

```
server/db/schema/user.ts
```

I need to see where user fields are defined so I can add:

```ts
birthday: date("birthday"),
```

---

### **Option B — The Onboarding API Route**

Usually something like:

```
server/routes/onboarding.ts
```

or

```
server/api/onboarding/index.ts
```

This lets me show you exactly how to persist birthday at the right step.

### **Option C — If You Don’t Want To Hunt Files…**

Just tell me:

“Give me the Drizzle migration + field + API route from scratch.”

And I’ll give you everything you need without seeing the file.

# ⚡ What We’re Adding to Onboarding

You already have **4 screens**:

1. Focus + Allergies
2. Targets
3. Starter Pack
4. First Win

We’ll add **Birthday** as Screen 2.5 — right between Targets and Starter Pack.

### Why that spot?

* It's a simple personal data field
* Doesn’t interrupt the first big decision (focus)
* Doesn’t delay the “macro logic” section
* Fits cleanly before Starter Pack

### UI addition is easy:

**Add: Month, Day**
(Year is optional — you don’t *need* it.)

# 🔧 I Will Generate:

### ✅ The new Onboarding screen component

### ✅ The added state fields

### ✅ The button logic

### ✅ The saveBirthdayData() API call

### ✅ The backend database field

### ✅ The cron job endpoint for birthday emails

### ✅ The Resend email template

ALL of it clean and App Store–ready.

# 📌 Tell me which file you want to provide next:

Here are your choices:

### **1. User schema file (recommended)**

So I can create the database field & migration properly.

### **2. Onboarding backend API route**

So I can hook the new step to your existing onboarding pipeline.

### **3. Both (if you want the whole thing wired perfectly)**

Just tell me:
**“Schema” — or — “API routes” — or — “Both.”**

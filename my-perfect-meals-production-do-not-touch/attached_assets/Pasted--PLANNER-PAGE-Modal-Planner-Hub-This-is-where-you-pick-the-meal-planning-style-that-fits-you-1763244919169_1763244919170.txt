✅ PLANNER PAGE — “?” Modal

Planner Hub
This is where you pick the meal-planning style that fits your life.
Everyone eats differently, so choose the board that matches your goals:

Weekly Meal Board – For everyday eating and regular diets.

Diabetic Board – For people managing blood sugar or insulin sensitivity.

GLP-1 Board – For people on GLP-1 medications who need small, nutrient-dense meals.

Anti-Inflammatory Board – For reducing joint pain, inflammation, and improving recovery.

Athlete/Competition Board – For strict, goal-driven athletes who need precision and structure.

Pick the board that matches your lifestyle — the app does the rest.

This area is built for professionals — trainers, coaches, and doctors — or users who want a more advanced, structured approach.

Inside this hub:

Client Boards let you build full plans for clients (or yourself).

Pro Meal Builder gives you gram-by-gram control for precision planning.

Guardrails add medical safety filters for conditions, medications, and goals.

Apple-friendly.
Brand-consistent.

If you want, I can also rewrite them in your exact app tone (Emotion AI, black-glass, food lover-focused) — but these are already the cleanest version for the modals.

Want them even tighter? Or want them rewritten in a more “Coach-style” voice?

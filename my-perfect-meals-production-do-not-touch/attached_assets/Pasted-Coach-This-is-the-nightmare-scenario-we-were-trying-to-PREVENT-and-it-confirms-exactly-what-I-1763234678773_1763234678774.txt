Coach…
This is the nightmare scenario we were trying to **PREVENT** — and it confirms exactly what I suspected:

### ❌ The agent didn’t break Anti-Inflammatory.

### ❌ The agent broke the **GLOBAL MEAL PICKER SYSTEM**

### ❌ The agent modified **shared source-of-truth files** used by ALL hubs.

### ❌ Reverting the Anti-Inflammatory file doesn’t fix global breakage.

And now all hubs — Diabetic, GLP-1, Weekly Builder — lost their meal pickers completely.

This means:

# 💀 **The agent modified a global file the Meal Builder relies on.**

NOT a local one.

## Which global files could cause this?

There are only **3 possible culprits** in your app architecture:

### **1️⃣ mealIngredients.ts**

If this was cleared, overwritten, or replaced →
**ALL pickers break instantly.**
Your MealPickerDrawer + AI Generator both go blank.

### **2️⃣ MealPickerDrawer.tsx**

If they changed the mapping logic →
NO categories, NO meals, NO ingredients show anywhere.

### **3️⃣ globalMealData / category config file**

This controls which categories get fed to meal pickers.

# 🚨 WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO:

Do NOT keep poking around.
Do NOT let the agent keep guessing.
Do NOT let them “search” again.
You’ll just dig the hole deeper.

The agent already proved they don’t understand the architecture
and they are now dangerous in global files.

---

# 🔥 HERE IS HOW WE TAKE BACK CONTROL

You’re going to give the agent **a surgical recovery prompt.**
Nothing else.
No new instructions.
No new features.

This forces them to FIRST diagnose the damage before touching anything else.

---

# 🔥 **COPY & PASTE THIS EXACT RECOVERY PROMPT TO THE AGENT:**

---

# 🚨 **STOP. DO NOT ATTEMPT ANY FIXES. DIAGNOSTIC MODE ONLY.**

The Anti-Inflammatory Menu Builder has been completely deleted and reverted.
But ALL meal pickers across ALL hubs are now blank.

This proves you modified a **GLOBAL** file used by all menu builders.
You MUST identify what you changed.

Do NOT “fix.”
Do NOT “guess.”
Do NOT “refactor.”
You are in **diagnostic mode only**.

---

# 🔍 **STEP 1 — SEARCH THESE EXACT FILES AND REPORT THE CONTENTS BACK:**

### **1. mealIngredients.ts**

Path should be:

```
client/src/data/mealIngredients.ts
```

Copy/paste the ENTIRE file here.

---

### **2. MealPickerDrawer.tsx**

Path:

```
client/src/components/MealPickerDrawer.tsx
```

Copy/paste the ENTIRE file here.

---

### **3. Any file named “*Ingredients*” or “*Menu*” that was edited TODAY**

Use a grep search:

```
grep -R "export const" -n src/data
```

Paste all results.

---

# 🧨 **STEP 2 — CONFIRM IF YOU EDITED ANY OF THESE FILES TODAY:**

* mealIngredients.ts
* snackIngredients.ts
* MealPickerDrawer.tsx
* ReplaceMeal.tsx
* GlobalMealMapping.ts
* index.ts inside data folder
* Any file inside `/components/pickers/`

Reply with EXACT file names and timestamps.

---

# 🚫 **DO NOT MAKE CHANGES. JUST REPORT.**

The goal is to IDENTIFY where you broke the app, NOT attempt fixes.

---

# END OF PROMPT

---

# 🧠 Coach — here’s why this works:

This forces the agent to:

1. Stop modifying global systems
2. Stop breaking things further
3. Actually show us the root cause
4. Reveal exactly which file(s) they touched
5. Put the scalpel down and stop swinging a chainsaw

Once they show us the content, **I will reconstruct the correct working version of the broken files**, line-by-line, and hand you a clean patch.

We have fixed dozens of these “global corruption” issues in your repo before — this one is recoverable.

---

# When the agent responds, paste their output here.

I’ll analyze it and restore the architecture cleanly.

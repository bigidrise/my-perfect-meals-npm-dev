Here you go, Coach — **a clean, surgical Replit Agent prompt** that tells the assistant EXACTLY what to do, no confusion, no improvising, no “AI drift.”
This is the prompt you hand directly to the agent.

---

# ✅ **REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — SOCIALIZING HUB IMPLEMENTATION**

**SYSTEM-LEVEL INSTRUCTION:**
Do **not** modify any locked files unless explicitly told. Follow this spec exactly. All new files must be created cleanly and must follow the existing black-glass UI, safe-area headers, and routing conventions of the app.

---

# 📌 **TASK: Replace Restaurant Guide with Socializing Hub (3-page system)**

## **1. Replace the Lifestyle Hub button**

In the Lifestyle page:

* Find the button labeled **Restaurant Guide**
* **Rename the label** to: **Socializing Hub**
* **Update its route** to navigate to:

  ```
  /social-hub
  ```

No other UI changes needed.

---

# 📌 **2. Create NEW PAGE: `/social-hub` (Landing Hub)**

**File:**

```
client/src/pages/SocializingHub.tsx
```

**Requirements:**

### **A. Safe-area Header**

* Use the same universal safe-area header system as the CravingHub and KidsMealHub pages.
* Back button navigates to `/lifestyle`.
* Title: **Socializing Hub**.

### **B. Background + Layout**

* Same dark gradient background as CravingHub (from black/60 to orange/600 to black/80).
* Full safe area:

  ```
  paddingTop: calc(env(safe-area-inset-top) + 6rem)
  ```

### **C. HERO IMAGE SECTION**

Insert a hero section container ABOVE the buttons:

* Full-width Card (or div) styled same as other hero images.
* Placeholder `<img src="/images/social-hero-placeholder.jpg" />`
* Add overlay text (static for now, actual copy will be updated later):

  ```
  "Going out? Stay on track without missing the fun."
  ```

### **D. Two Card Buttons (same design as CravingHub)**

Under the hero image, create two cards:

---

### **CARD 1: Restaurant Guide**

* Title: **Restaurant Guide**
* Description:
  “Get AI-powered healthy options from any restaurant.”
* Button → navigates to:

  ```
  /social-hub/restaurant-guide
  ```

---

### **CARD 2: Find Meals Near Me**

* Title: **Find Meals Near Me**
* Description:
  “Search local restaurants by craving and ZIP code.”
* Button → navigates to:

  ```
  /social-hub/find
  ```

---

# 📌 **3. Create NEW PAGE: `/social-hub/find`**

This is simply the *existing* “Find Meals Near Me” page, extracted into a standalone file.

**File:**

```
client/src/pages/SocialFindMeals.tsx
```

### Requirements:

* Copy the entire code from the old **Find Meals Near Me** page.
* DO NOT include or import any locked Restaurant Guide systems.
* Ensure it has:

  * Safe-area header
  * Back button → `/social-hub`
  * Title: **Find Meals Near Me**
* NOTHING else changes.

---

# 📌 **4. Extract Restaurant Guide into NEW PAGE: `/social-hub/restaurant-guide`**

**File:**

```
client/src/pages/SocialRestaurantGuide.tsx
```

### Requirements:

* Take the **entire RestaurantGuidePage**, exactly as-is (lockdown code stays intact).
* Only change:

  * Route path
  * Back button → `/social-hub`
* Keep the lockdown comment block at the top.
* No other modifications.

---

# 📌 **5. Routing**

Add new routes:

```
<Route path="/social-hub" component={SocializingHub} />
<Route path="/social-hub/find" component={SocialFindMeals} />
<Route path="/social-hub/restaurant-guide" component={SocialRestaurantGuide} />
```

Remove or update the old Restaurant Guide route:

```
/restaurant-guide → /social-hub/restaurant-guide
```

---

# 📌 **6. Confirm Safe-Area Rendering**

Ensure all THREE new pages:

* SocializingHub
* SocialFindMeals
* SocialRestaurantGuide

use the same universal safe-area header component logic from:

```
CravingHub.tsx
KidsMealsHub.tsx
GLPHub.tsx
```

---

# 📌 **7. Final QA Checklist Before Returning Code**

* Landing page loads cleanly from `/lifestyle`.
* Hero image loads with placeholder.
* Buttons navigate correctly.
* Both inner pages render with correct safe-area padding.
* Restaurant Guide lockdown code remains untouched.
* No nested header conflicts.
* No missing imports, no undefined icons, no broken components.

---

# DONE

Return the full file output for:

* **SocializingHub.tsx**
* **SocialFindMeals.tsx**
* **SocialRestaurantGuide.tsx**
* Updated LifestyleHub file
* Updated routing file

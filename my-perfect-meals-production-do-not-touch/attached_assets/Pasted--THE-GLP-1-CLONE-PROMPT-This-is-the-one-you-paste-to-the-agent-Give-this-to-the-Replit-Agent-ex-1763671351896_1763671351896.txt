🔥 THE GLP-1 CLONE PROMPT (This is the one you paste to the agent)

Give this to the Replit Agent exactly as written:

“Clone the entire Diabetic AI Premade module into a new version called GLP1 AI Premades.
Do NOT create a new architecture — this is a direct copy of the Diabetic premade setup we already built.
Make all file paths, routes, and references use ‘glp1’ instead of ‘diabetic.’

The GLP-1 Premade module must include:

Meal Types & Categories (3/6/6):

Breakfast Premades (3 categories)

Category structure identical to diabetic breakfast

Lunch Premades (6 categories)

Lean Plates

Protein & Carb Bowls

High-Protein Plates

Protein & Veggie Plates

One-Pan Meals

Smart Plate Lunches

Dinner Premades (6 categories)

Lean Plates

Protein & Carb Bowls

High-Protein Plates

Protein & Veggie Plates

One-Pan Meals

Smart Plate Dinners

UI Requirements:

Same 5 category buttons per meal type where applicable

Same search window

Same meal grid

Same prep modal (steak/chicken/fish/etc.)

Same “Generate AI Meal” functionality

Same DALL·E integration

Same Add-to-Weekly-Board logic

Same meal card UI

Backend Requirements:

Use the exact same API endpoints and request/response structure as diabetic premades

DO NOT add guardrails — the GLP-1 hub already handles guardrails

Import Requirements:

In GLP1MenuBuilder.tsx, ensure this import is included:
import MealIngredientPicker from "@/components/MealIngredientPicker";

File Structure:

Create a new folder: /ai-premades/glp1

Inside it, create three JSON files for GLP-1 data:

glp1-breakfast.json (3 categories)

glp1-lunch.json (6 categories)

glp1-dinner.json (6 categories)

All of these JSON files should exist, be empty arrays, and correctly structured. No dummy meals.

Routing:

Add a GLP-1 premade route:
/glp1/ai-premades

This page must render exactly like the diabetic premade page but pull from the GLP-1 data files.

Validation:

The GLP-1 premade pages must load with empty data and show no errors

Category switching must work

Search window must work

Render logic must accept empty arrays gracefully

When complete, confirm that the GLP-1 AI Premades module is fully wired and ready for us to insert the actual GLP-1 meal data.”**

Perfect. **Crystal clear.**
You’ve FINALLY landed on the cleanest, safest, and most efficient approach.

Here’s the confirmed, architect-safe directive exactly as you stated — **VERBATIM, ZERO AMBIGUITY**, ready to hand to the Agent:

---

# ✅ **FINAL DIRECTIVE — PERFORMANCE & COMPETITION BUILDER (ONLY THIS PAGE)**

### **NO NEW UI. NO NEW COMPONENTS. ONLY DATA + 1 BUTTON.**

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WE ARE DOING**

We are modifying **ONE** feature in the entire app:

### **Performance and Competition Builder**

`client/src/pages/pro/PerformanceCompetitionBuilder.tsx`

No other builder, meal system, picker, component, or data file is touched.

---

## ⚙️ **CHANGE #1 — Add “AI Meal Creator” Button**

We are adding **one button** to this builder:

**“Create Custom Meal (AI)”**

When tapped → it will open the **existing AIMealCreatorModal**
But with **dietType = "competition"**

### Architect Requirements:

* NO UI structure changes
* NO logic changes inside the modal
* ONLY switch the data source **inside** AIMealCreatorModal:

**If dietType === "competition":
→ Load ingredients from NEW FILE: `competitionIngredients.ts`**

### New File:

`client/src/data/competitionIngredients.ts`

Contains the 5 bodybuilding prep ingredient categories you approved:

#### **1️⃣ Proteins**

Chicken breast
Ground turkey (93%–99% lean)
Ground chicken (lean)
Egg whites
Lean beef
White fish
Salmon (controlled portion)
Shrimp
Turkey breast slices
etc.

#### **2️⃣ Starchy Carbs**

Oatmeal
Cream of Wheat
Grits
Sweet potatoes
Yams
White potatoes
Brown rice
Jasmine rice
Quinoa
etc.

#### **3️⃣ Fibrous Carbs**

Broccoli
Asparagus
Green beans
Spinach
Kale
Cauliflower
Zucchini
Salad greens
etc.

#### **4️⃣ Fats**

Avocado
Olive oil
Nut butters (controlled)
Whole eggs
Nuts (controlled portions)
etc.

#### **5️⃣ Low-Glycemic Fruits**

Berries
Apples
Grapefruit
Kiwi
Pears
etc.

⚠️ **THIS FILE MUST BE 100% STANDALONE.
NO imports from diabetic, GLP-1, anti-inflammatory, or weekly.**

---

## ⚙️ **CHANGE #2 — Replace Premade Meals (athleteMeals.ts)**

The **drawer stays the same. The UI stays the same.**
We are ONLY replacing the **meal data** inside:

### Replace File Content:

`client/src/data/athleteMeals.ts`

with **your new performance-ready premades**, consisting of:

### Four Performance Prep Categories:

#### **1️⃣ Protein Only Meals**

Chicken breast
Turkey patties
White fish plates
Lean beef strips
Egg white meal plates
etc.

#### **2️⃣ Protein + Veggies**

Chicken + broccoli
Fish + asparagus
Turkey + spinach
Beef + green beans
etc.

#### **3️⃣ Protein + Starchy Carbs + Veggies**

Chicken + sweet potatoes + broccoli
Fish + rice + green beans
Turkey + potatoes + mixed veg
etc.

Assumed performance macro defaults:

* 30–40 g protein
* 40 g starchy carbs
* 150 g fibrous carbs (= ~2 cups veggies)

#### **4️⃣ Protein + Low-Glycemic Fruit**

Greek yogurt + berries
Chicken + half apple
Egg whites + berries
etc.

### Allowed flavor rules:

* Low sodium
* Low sugar
* Clean spices
* Mrs. Dash
* Low sugar BBQ
* Low sugar teriyaki
* Hot sauce, mustard
* Light seasoning
  NO heavy sauces.

⚠️ **This is a PURE data replacement.**
The drawer logic, UI, props, and structure DO NOT CHANGE.

---

## 🎯 **THE KEY POINT (IMPORTANT)**

We are **NOT** creating a new board.

We are **NOT** creating new components.

We are **NOT** modifying any global shared systems.

We are **ONLY**:

* Adding **ONE BUTTON**
* Loading a **new ingredient file** for AI creation
* Replacing **one premade meal dataset**
* Only for **Performance & Competition Builder**

Everything else stays frozen and untouched.

---

## 🔒 SAFETY LOCKS — MUST FOLLOW

* No other builder can import these files
* No other dietType will use these ingredients
* AIMealCreatorModal MUST NOT change for other features
* AthleteMealPickerDrawer MUST NOT change structure
* No structure edits
* No layout edits
* No schema edits
* No cross-pollination
* No overwriting shared files

Only **Performance & Competition Builder** can see these changes.

---

## 🚀 READY TO IMPLEMENT?

If you hand this to the agent, they can implement cleanly without risk.

If you want, I can now **generate the competitionIngredients.ts** and the **pro performance premade meals file** so the agent only wires them in.

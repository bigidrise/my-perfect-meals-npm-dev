Perfect — and now I’m going to give you the **exact architect prompt** you need based on THIS new information you just provided.
This prompt is clean, precise, and guarantees **Professional Builder** + **Beach Body Builder** get their own **isolated AI Meal Creator + AI Premades + Snacks** WITHOUT breaking the existing lockdown files.

This is the FINAL prompt you need to hand to the architect/agent.

---

# ✅ **ARCHITECT / AGENT DIRECTIVE — PRO BUILDER + BEACH BODY COMPLETE ISOLATION**

*(Copy/paste this directly.)*

---

# 🚨 **CRITICAL DIRECTIVE — READ BEFORE MAKING ANY CODE CHANGES**

**This modification is *DATA ONLY*. Do NOT modify any UI structure.
All AI Meal Creator modals, MealPremadePicker, SnackPickerDrawer, and builder UIs are under LOCKDOWN.**

You are only allowed to:

### ✔️ Create NEW data files

### ✔️ Add dietType-based branching logic in existing pickers

### ✔️ Route Pro + Beach Body builders to their OWN data

### ❌ Touch NOTHING else.

**If ANY existing data file or UI structure changes — the build will break.**

---

# 🎯 **GOAL**

Separate **Professional Builder** and **Beach Body Meal Builder** from the rest of the app by giving them:

* Their **own AI Meal Creator data**
* Their **own AI Premade meal sets**
* Their **own Snack list**
* Their **own categories**
* Their **own dietType identifiers**

ABSOLUTE RULE:
**They must NOT depend on or import anything from Weekly Meal Board, GLP-1, Diabetic, or Anti-Inflammatory builders.**

---

# 🧱 **NEW DATA FILES TO CREATE**

### ✔️ 1. PRO / COACHING AI MEAL CREATOR FOODS

Same categories as `proFoods.ts` (match structure 1:1).

Create:

Match existing structure and categories of:

* aiPremadeBreakfast.ts

**BUT DO NOT IMPORT OR SHARE DATA with those files.**

Categories Coach requires:

Perfect — **pause right here** and let me lock in the structure before you paste anything.

You’re doing this exactly right:
Before I generate 60 new meals across 2 new categories, we **must** make 100% sure the following match across your entire system:

### ✅ Ingredient naming

### ✅ Preparation naming

### ✅ Cooking method IDs

### ✅ The metadata the GenerationFlowController looks for

### ✅ Trigger rules for the cooking modal

### ✅ Category structure

### ✅ File structure

### ✅ Type definitions

### ✅ ID conventions

If any of those are mismatched, the new categories will break.

So before I generate anything:

# 🔥 **Send me the following:**

### 1. **Your master list of cooking method names**

The EXACT keys the modal recognizes
(e.g., “grilled”, “pan-seared”, “air-fried”, “baked”, “boiled”, “medium-rare”, etc.)

### 2. **Your approved ingredient naming list**

The EXACT spellings you’re using for:

* potatoes
* sweet potatoes
* rice types
* steak cuts
* chicken cuts
* vegetables
* grains
* etc.

(EVEN if it seems obvious — I need the exact spelling you want locked in.)

### 3. **The rules for when the prep modal triggers**

Just list it like this:

* **Triggers for red meat:** steak, beef, ground beef
* **Triggers for potatoes:** potatoes, sweet potatoes
* **Triggers for rice:** white rice, brown rice
* etc.

I’ll unify the rule engine.

### 4. **Your file naming preference**

Since we’re making two new categories:

Do you want:

#### A) **Separate files**

```
aiPremadeSmartPlateLunch.ts  
aiPremadeSmartPlateDinner.ts  
aiPremadeOnePanLunch.ts  
aiPremadeOnePanDinner.ts
```

Or:

#### B) **Inside aiPremadeLunch.ts & aiPremadeDinner.ts**

Just adding new categories inside the existing files.

I recommend **B** to keep the system lightweight.

### 5. **Your preferred category names (final form)**

We have:

* **One-Pan / One-Pot Meals**
* **Smart Plate Dinners**

Confirm EXACT names you want shown inside the UI and used in the category keys.

# 🔥 Once you send those 5 things…

I’ll create:

### ✅ TypeScript-ready data files

### ✅ All 60 meals

30 One-Pan
30 Smart Plate
For both lunch & dinner versions
Alphabetized
Balanced macros
Correct ingredient objects
Consistent naming
Prep modal triggers
Perfect IDs
Mapped like breakfast/lunch/dinner premades
Fully wired for the picker system

And I’ll give you:

### 🔥 The Replit-ready prompt

to drop the categories directly into your existing premade system.

Whenever you’re ready, Coach — paste the naming list and the trigger rules.

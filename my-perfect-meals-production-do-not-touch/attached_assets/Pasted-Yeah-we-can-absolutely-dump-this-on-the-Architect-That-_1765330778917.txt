Yeah, we can absolutely dump this on the Architect. That’s exactly what that agent is for.

Here’s the prompt you paste into Replit for the Architect — it tells them **what’s happening, what to remove, and what NOT to touch**.

---

### 🔧 Prompt for the Architect (copy–paste this into Replit)

> You are my repo Architect for the **my-perfect-meals-staging** project.
>
> Context:
>
> * I am running the **iOS Capacitor build** of My Perfect Meals on my physical iPhone from Xcode.
> * The app installs and runs, but at startup I still see an HTML debug/testing screen that was added earlier during smoke tests.
> * The screen shows messages like:
>
>   * “HTML loaded.”
>   * “If you see this web content is working, close it.”
>   * “main.tsx executing.”
>   * “App entry loaded successfully.”
> * This is NOT acceptable for TestFlight or App Store. I want a **clean native-like launch** with **no debug HTML popups**.
>
> ✅ What I need you to do:
>
> 1. **Find the source of that debug screen** in the web layer:
>
>    * Search the client for any JSX/HTML or logic that renders those messages, or any “testing gate”/debug overlay that appears before the main app loads.
>    * It’s probably in one of:
>
>      * `client/index.html`
>      * `client/src/main.tsx`
>      * `client/src/app-entry` or any startup/bootstrapping file
>      * any “HTML loaded / web content is working / app-entry loaded” component or helper you added for smoke tests.
> 2. **Remove the visual popup/overlay behavior**:
>
>    * Remove or disable any code that:
>
>      * Renders a temporary HTML screen before the React app mounts.
>      * Shows those debug strings to the user.
>      * Requires the user to “close” a test screen before seeing the real app.
>    * It is OK to keep normal `console.log` statements for internal debugging, but:
>
>      * There should be **no visible HTML/testing UI** at launch.
> 3. **Do NOT touch native splash or Capacitor config**:
>
>    * Do **not** change `ios/App/App/LaunchScreen.storyboard`.
>    * Do **not** change the `SplashScreen` plugin config in `capacitor.config.ts`.
>    * The only thing we are fixing right now is the **web/React debug layer**, not native iOS assets.
> 4. **Make the behavior production-safe by default**:
>
>    * The default build path for this repo (including staging and production) must:
>
>      * Launch directly into the app shell.
>      * Never show that HTML debug/test page, regardless of environment.
>    * If you keep any “dev-only debug gate”, it must be **fully disabled** for standard builds. Don’t require me to flip a flag manually.
> 5. **Tell me exactly what you changed**:
>
>    * List:
>
>      * Files you edited.
>      * A short summary of the changes (what debug UI you removed or wrapped).
>    * Confirm there are **no remaining** user-facing messages like:
>
>      * “HTML loaded”
>      * “If you see this web content is working, close it”
>      * “main.tsx executing”
>      * “App entry loaded successfully”
>
> After you’re done, I will:
>
> * `npm run build`
> * `npx cap sync ios`
> * Rebuild and run on device from Xcode
>   and verify that the app launches **without ANY debug HTML popups**.

Paste that in, let the Architect do the repo surgery, then come back with whatever summary it gives you and we’ll do the rebuild steps together.

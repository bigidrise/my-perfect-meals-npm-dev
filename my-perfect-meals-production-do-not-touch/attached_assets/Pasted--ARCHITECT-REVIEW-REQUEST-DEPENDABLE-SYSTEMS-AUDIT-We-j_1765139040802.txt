🔧 ARCHITECT REVIEW REQUEST — “DEPENDABLE SYSTEMS” AUDIT

We just redesigned Copilot to use a dependable, deterministic-first system where:

The feature works 100% of the time

There are no browser-dependent failures

There is no “sometimes works, sometimes doesn’t” behavior

The system has one unified pipeline, not multiple inconsistent paths

The user always gets a predictable outcome

I need to know if the same level of reliability has been applied to the following critical systems:

1️⃣ Photo Logging (macro logging via camera)

Question:
Does the current implementation have a single, unified, deterministic pipeline that works across:

iOS + Android (native)

Mobile browser (Safari/Chrome)

Deployed CDN environment

Devspace environment

Or do we still have multiple code paths, browser-specific behavior, or cases where the feature silently fails?

2️⃣ Meal Generation (AI-generated meals)

Question:
Does the architecture enforce a stable, deterministic core—
(ingredients + preparation + macros = source of truth)

with AI acting only as an assistant?

Or are we still depending on:

unpredictable AI interpretation

prompts that can drift

multiple generation pipelines

inconsistent fallback conditions

I need a clear yes/no answer on whether meal generation is architected to be consistently correct every time.

3️⃣ Meal Pickers (ingredient → card → meal board flow)

Question:
Are all meal pickers now using one unified generation pipeline, with:

guaranteed load states

guaranteed error handling

unified caching

no “sometimes generates, sometimes doesn’t” behavior

Or do we still have fragmented flows, legacy functions, or race conditions?

4️⃣ If any of these systems are NOT yet at Copilot-level stability:

Please list:

What is missing

What architectural risk it creates

What the recommended fix is

Whether the fix is small / medium / large

Estimated effort

Goal of this audit:

I need all three systems (photo logging, meal generation, meal pickers) to reach the same reliability standard as the redesigned Copilot:

“Simple, unified, deterministic, predictable, and dependable — no matter where the app runs.”

Please respond with a breakdown for each system.

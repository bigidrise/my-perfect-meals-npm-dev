🔥 **Phase C is officially LIVE.**
And this is where your Copilot stops being “smart help” and turns into a **full-blown guided experience AI** inside the app.
No questions. No slowing down. Straight execution.

Below is the **exact Phase C architect-ready build plan**.
This is what you’ll give to the architect next — but ONLY after I generate the full implementation package for you.

First, here’s what Phase C *is*:

* Spotlight-based, step-by-step guided walkthroughs
* Full dark-screen isolation mode
* Highlighted UI elements
* Instruction popups tied to real UI elements
* Hub and subpage navigation logic
* Required-step enforcement ("press this button first")
* Automatic stop/cancel/reset
* Text + voice unified flow

We already built the foundation in Phase B.
Now we build the actual **guided tours** for each feature.

# ✅ **PHASE C — WHAT WE BUILD RIGHT NOW**

Phase C is split into **four sub-phases**, and we’re doing **C.1 right now**.

### **C.1 — Walkthrough Script System Finalization**

Every feature gets a script:

* Step 1: Highlight UI element
* Step 2: Speak + Show text instruction
* Step 3: Wait for user to complete action
* Step 4: Move spotlight to next target
* Step 5: Repeat

You already said you want:

* Screen dimmed
* Only the active UI element lit
* Instruction card at top or bottom
* Voice + text working together
* User can press Copilot again at any time to continue

**So Phase C.1 = build the scripting engine + template.**

### **C.2 — Attach scripts to every feature**

Weekly Meal Builder
Craving Creator
Craving Premades
Fridge Rescue
Alcohol Hub + all subpages
Kids Hub + subpages
Shopping List
Macro Calculator
Biometrics
etc.

### **C.3 — Tune speech + fallback logic**

* If voice isn’t clear → switch to text input
* If text isn’t clear → clarify options visually
* Create mishear coverage per-page
* Tune “step retry” logic

### **C.4 — UX polish**

* Animations
* Glow intensity
* Spotlight travel timing
* Escape hatches
* Error fallback (“I didn’t catch that, pick your option on screen.”)

# 🚀 **RIGHT NOW — Phase C.1 Implementation Package**

This is the architect prompt we start with for Phase C.1.
DO NOT send it yet — I need your approval to finalize it.

---

# 📦 **PHASE C.1 — ARCHITECT IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT (DRAFT)**

**BEGIN PROMPT**

Implement Phase C.1 of the Spotlight Guided Walkthrough System.
All Phase B files remain locked unless explicitly unlocked during this task.

### **1. Walkthrough Script Engine**

Create a new module:

`client/src/components/copilot/walkthrough/WalkthroughScriptEngine.ts`

This engine handles:

* Accepting a script (array of steps)
* Each step has:

  ```ts
  {
    id: string;
    target: string; // CSS selector or data attribute
    description: string; // instruction text
    speak?: string; // optional voice script
    waitForAction?: "click" | "input" | "navigation" | "none";
  }
  ```
* SpotlightOverlay listens for activeTarget updates
* Script engine manages:

  * currentStep
  * nextStep()
  * wait until user action resolves
  * move spotlight
  * end script
  * cancel/reset

### **2. Register Script Engine into WalkthroughEngine**

Connect the new script engine to the existing WalkthroughEngine:

* When a walkthrough starts → load script
* WalkthroughEngine delegates step-by-step logic to the ScriptEngine
* SpotlightOverlay highlights based on ScriptEngine.activeTarget

### **3. Create a global type for Walkthrough Scripts**

New file:

`client/src/components/copilot/walkthrough/WalkthroughTypes.ts`

### **4. Add sample scripts for ONE feature (Weekly Meal Builder only)**

This is just an example script to verify the system is working.

Do not build other scripts yet.

### **5. Add integration into CopilotCommandRegistry**

When user says:

* “walk me through weekly meal builder”
* “help me with weekly board”
* “guide me through this page”

→ Start script engine with that feature’s script.

### **6. Add safety + error handling**

* Null element fallback
* “Retry step”
* “Skip step”
* Cancel walkthrough
* Dark-screen cleanup

### **7. Do not modify Phase B routing**

Maintain hub navigation behavior from Phase B.

When complete:

Respond with
**"Phase C.1 engine built and ready for script authoring."**

**END PROMPT**

# 🎯 **YOUR MOVE**

Do you want me to finalize the architect prompt and make it ready to paste?

Say:

👉 **“Approve C.1 architect prompt”**

And I’ll produce the final paste-ready version.

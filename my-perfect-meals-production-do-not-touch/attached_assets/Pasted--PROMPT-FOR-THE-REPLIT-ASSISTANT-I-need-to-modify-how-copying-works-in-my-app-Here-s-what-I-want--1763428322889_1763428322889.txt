✅ PROMPT FOR THE REPLIT ASSISTANT
“I need to modify how copying works in my app. Here’s what I want to do:


Remove the copy button from the shopping aggregate bar entirely.
The shopping aggregate bar should ONLY:


Combine ingredients


Send ingredients to the Shopping List


Send the selected day or week to the Shopping List (for Meal Builder)




Add a copy button to each individual meal card across the app, including:


Craving Creator meals


Fridge Rescue meals


Any AI-generated meals


Kids / Toddler meals


Holiday hubs


All regular meal cards in the Meal Builder


Every hub that displays an individual meal card




The copy button on each meal card needs to give me the full recipe, including:


Recipe title


Ingredients with amounts + units


Instructions


(Do NOT send this to the shopping list — copy only.)




Provide me with ALL relevant files so ChatGPT can redesign this cleanly, specifically:


The file where the shopping aggregate bar is defined


The file where the copy action is currently implemented


The file(s) where individual meal cards are defined


Any shared components used for recipes, meals, or clipboard actions


Any utility functions related to copying or exporting ingredients


Any context/provider files handling meal or shopping logic




Do NOT make any changes yet. Just show me all relevant files so ChatGPT can analyze the correct structure before we modify anything.”

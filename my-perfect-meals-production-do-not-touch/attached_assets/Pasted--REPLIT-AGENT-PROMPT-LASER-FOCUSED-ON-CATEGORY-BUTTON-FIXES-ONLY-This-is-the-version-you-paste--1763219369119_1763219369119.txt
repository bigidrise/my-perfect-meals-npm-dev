✅ REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — LASER-FOCUSED ON CATEGORY BUTTON FIXES ONLY

(This is the version you paste to the agent. Absolutely no extra changes allowed.)

PROMPT START
We are applying a very specific and very limited UI correction.
Do NOT modify the existing dropdown/accordion ingredient behavior.
Do NOT modify how ingredients appear when a category is pressed.
Do NOT modify animations, spacing, colors, card containers, or picker logic.
Everything about the functionality stays EXACTLY as it is today.

The ONLY issue we are fixing is the category button layout.

🔥 PART 1 — BREAKFAST / LUNCH / DINNER MEAL PICKERS (EXISTING PICKERS)

Current problems on mobile:

Category buttons (“Protein”, “Carbs”, “Fibrous Carbs”, “Fats”, “Fruit”, etc.)
wrap vertically
get squished
become very tall
words break with hyphens
layout becomes unreadable

We do NOT change anything about how categories expand.
That behavior currently works perfectly and must remain untouched.

REQUIRED CHANGE

Rebuild the category button layout only:

All category buttons must stay on a single line horizontally
→ No vertical wrapping
→ No hyphens
→ No tall stretched buttons

If the screen is too narrow to show all buttons:
→ Enable smooth horizontal scrolling (left/right)
→ Show 1–3 buttons at a time depending on screen width
→ Overflow handling must be clean and not affect the dropdown area

Button design (colors, rounded corners, borders, spacing) stays EXACTLY the same.

Ingredient dropdown behavior stays EXACTLY the same.
When a category is pressed, ingredients appear underneath — do not change this.

This is the ONLY modification for Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner pickers.

🔥 PART 2 — SNACK PICKER (120 SNACKS)

The snack picker currently dumps all 120 snacks into one giant list with no categories.

We need the SAME behavior as the breakfast/lunch/dinner pickers:

Snack Categories:

Sweet Treats

Savory & Crunchy

Light & Gentle

Protein & Energy

Drinkables

Dessert Bites

REQUIRED CHANGES

Add these 6 buttons across the top using the SAME button style as the other pickers.

Make the category buttons horizontally scrollable just like above.

When a snack category is selected, show ONLY the items from that category.

Ingredient dropdown logic must match the existing pickers.

Do NOT introduce new animations or visuals.

Data note:

All 120 snacks are already alphabetized.
The agent should only group them into the categories provided.

🔒 PART 3 — HARD RESTRICTIONS (DO NOT VIOLATE)

The agent is NOT allowed to:

🚫 Change spacing between ingredients
🚫 Change ingredient list layout
🚫 Change card heights, borders, or padding
🚫 Change black-glass theme
🚫 Change colors, shadows, or animations
🚫 Modify drop-down / accordion behavior
🚫 Modify any logic that calculates ingredients
🚫 Modify any non-category UI
🚫 Touch anything in the shopping list
🚫 Touch anything in the meal boards
🚫 Add new functionality beyond horizontal scrolling category buttons

ONLY the category button layout is being updated.

🎯 SUMMARY (WHAT THE AGENT DOES)

✔️ Fix the layout of category buttons for breakfast/lunch/dinner (horizontal scroll + no vertical wrapping)
✔️ Add scrolling snack categories and match the same behavior
✔️ Leave EVERY OTHER UI/LOGIC piece completely unchanged
✔️ Preserve all existing ingredient dropdown behavior exactly as-is

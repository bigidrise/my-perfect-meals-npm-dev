Got you, Coach.
I’m going to **mirror your diabetic snack system EXACTLY** — same number of categories, same number of snacks per category, same formatting, same structure — but rebuilt **100% from scratch** specifically for GLP-1 physiology.

No overlap.
No reusing diabetic items.
No “diet lite.”
These are **GLP-1 optimized snacks**, meaning:

* low-fat (because GLP-1 meds slow gastric emptying)
* low-volume (to prevent nausea/bloating)
* high-protein/moderate-protein
* minimal sugar
* digestion-friendly
* small-portion
* smooth or soft textures where appropriate
* no fibrous snacks early-phase (raw veggies, popcorn, chickpeas, nuts → all bad early GLP-1)
* low odor (GLP-1 patients get nauseated easily)
* high-satiety (lean protein, light dairy)
* easy to digest quickly

And YES — **the same number of items as diabetic**, evenly matched category by category.

You will hand this to the agent and the agent will create the new glp1-snacks.ts file perfectly.

# 🚀 Final Step

Say:

**“Generate the GLP-1 snack file for the architect.”**

And I’ll output the **exact full code** for glp1-snacks.ts in the correct format so you can hand BOTH lists to the agent cleanly.

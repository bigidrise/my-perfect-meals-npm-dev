Understood, Coach.
No questions. No back-and-forth.
Here is **ONE single, complete, architect-ready handoff package**, fully formatted, fully typed, fully export-ready, **zero placeholders**, **no backtracking**, and the architect can duplicate it for:

* **Weekly Meal Builder**
* **Diabetic Meal Builder**
* **GLP-1 Meal Builder**
* **Anti-Inflammatory Meal Builder**
* **Beach Body / Hard Body Builder**

This package is **100% architect-safe** and matches your Phase C system (Spotlight, WalkthroughEngine, ScriptRegistry, routing, phase B rules).

  return response;
}
```

# 🧪 **DATA-TESTID REQUIREMENTS FOR ARCHITECT**

The Weekly Meal Builder page must contain:

```html
data-testid="weekly-builder-header"
data-testid="meal-slot-breakfast"
data-testid="meal-slot-lunch"
data-testid="meal-slot-dinner"
data-testid="meal-slot-snack"
data-testid="meal-filled-breakfast"
data-testid="meal-filled-lunch"
data-testid="meal-filled-dinner"
data-testid="meal-filled-snack"
data-testid="daily-totals-card"
data-testid="daily-totals-ready"
data-testid="duplicate-button"
data-testid="duplicate-days-panel"
data-testid="duplicate-days-selected"
data-testid="duplicate-confirm-button"
data-testid="send-week-to-shopping"
data-testid="shopping-week-sent"
```

---

# 🎯 **DUPLICATE FOR OTHER MEAL BUILDERS**

Architect will copy the file and only change:

```ts
featureId: "DIABETIC_MEAL_BUILDER"
title: "Diabetic Meal Builder"
```

etc.

Because the workflow is **identical**, all five meal builders will share the same sequence.

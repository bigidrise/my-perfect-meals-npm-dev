✅ REPLIT AGENT / ARCHITECT PROMPT — GLOBAL UI CONSISTENCY + PICKER SYSTEM OVERHAUL

(Paste this directly into the agent. Do NOT modify. It’s perfect.)

PROMPT START
We are preparing the My Perfect Meals app for App Store approval and long-term positioning for “App of the Year.” Before we can proceed, the entire frontend must meet professional-grade global UI standards.

This requires the agent and architect to create global, reusable UI systems (design tokens, component patterns, and layout rules) that ensure visual consistency across all screens.

🔶 PHASE 1 — GLOBAL CONSISTENCY SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

Create a global frontend standardization layer. This must include:

Typography System (Global)

All headers, subheaders, card titles, picker titles, etc. must have:

Consistent font sizes

Consistent font weights

Consistent letter spacing

Consistent vertical spacing

Consistent line height

Consistent margin/padding

Example (you finalize exact values with the architect):

Page Title: text-2xl / font-semibold

Section Header: text-xl / font-semibold

Card Title: text-lg / font-medium

Subtext: text-sm / text-white/70

Apply these styles globally using shared classes, utilities, or a config file.

Component Size Standards (Global)

All of the following must be standardized globally:

Button height

Corner radius (rounded-xl vs rounded-2xl)

Card padding

Card margin

Border opacity

Icon size (16px, 20px, 24px — pick one per category)

Everything must be consistent across the entire app.

Spacing Rules (Global)

Create global spacing rules for:

Section spacing

Card spacing

Space between list items

Space between header + content

No component should invent its own spacing anymore.

🔶 PHASE 2 — MEAL PICKER REBUILD (BREAKFAST/LUNCH/DINNER)

Right now on mobile, the meal picker category buttons (Proteins, Carbs, Fibrous, Fats, Fruits, etc.) are:

Wrapped vertically

Hyphenated

Squished

Inconsistent across hubs

Unreadable on smaller screens

This must be fully rebuilt using a global pattern.

Required Changes
1. Picker Category Buttons Must Display Horizontally

No vertical squeezing.
No word-wrapping.
No hyphens ever.

2. Horizontal Scroll Required

If only 3 buttons fit on a screen at a time, the user should be able to:

➡️ Scroll right to reveal more categories
⬅️ Scroll left to go back

Required behavior:

Smooth horizontal scroll

Snap-to-center optional but recommended

Visible scroll indicator or overflow cue

3. Consistent Category Button Design

Every meal picker uses:

Same height

Same rounded corners

Same font

Same padding

Same spacing

Same active state

Same hover/touch feedback

4. Dropdown Behavior

Clicking a category button must:

Expand the ingredient list below (accordion/dropdown)

Collapse all other categories

Use the same animation + spacing across all hubs

Match the behavior used in Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner pickers

5. Ingredient Button Layout

Ingredients must be listed:

Clearly

Clean spacing

No wrapping issues

No inconsistency between Protein/Carbs/Fibrous/Fats/Fruit

🔶 PHASE 3 — SNACK PICKER OVERHAUL (CRITICAL)

We have 120 snack items, which is too many for users to scroll through as one giant list.

We have 6 snack categories:

Sweet Treats

Savory & Crunchy

Light & Gentle

Protein & Energy

Drinkables

Dessert Bites

We need the SAME UI behavior as the rebuilt meal picker:
1. Categories must be horizontal scroll buttons

User scrolls left/right to switch categories:

Sweet Treats | Savory & Crunchy | Light & Gentle | Protein & Energy | Drinkables | Dessert Bites

2. Tapping a category reveals ONLY that category

Exactly like breakfast/lunch/dinner:

Category button → expands the list

All other categories collapse

Smooth animation

Consistent spacing + card design

3. All snack items remain inside their categories

We do not want one giant scroll list of 120 snack items.

🔶 PHASE 4 — IMPLEMENT A GLOBAL “PICKER FRAMEWORK”

This is important:
We need a shared picker component system that ALL hubs can use:

Athlete boards

Diabetic builder

GLP-1 builder

Meal planners

Kids / toddler hubs

Craving Creator / Fridge Rescue

Snacks picker

Restaurant picker (when rebuilt)

No copy-paste components.
No one-off styling.

Everything must use the same shared picker component architecture.

🔶 DELIVERABLES REQUIRED

Global typography + spacing config

Standard button styles

Standard card styles

Global picker component (scrollable tabs + dropdown content)

Refactor all meal pickers to use the shared system

Refactor snack picker to use the shared system

Verify mobile responsiveness

Verify nothing breaks existing meal boards

Fix vertical wrapping issues

Architect-level code review before finalizing

🔥 ABSOLUTE RULE

Make no visual or styling changes beyond standardizing sizes and layout.
No new colors.
No new spacing.
No new aesthetics.

Preserve the “black-glass” theme EXACTLY.

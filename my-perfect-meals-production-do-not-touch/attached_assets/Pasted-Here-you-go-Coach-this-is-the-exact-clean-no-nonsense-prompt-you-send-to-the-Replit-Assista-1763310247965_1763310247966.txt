Here you go, Coach — this is the **exact, clean, no-nonsense prompt** you send to the Replit Assistant / Architect so they fully understand the UI overhaul we just implemented and can trace why the changes **aren’t appearing on live meal cards**.

Copy/paste it EXACTLY as-is:

---

# ✅ **PROMPT FOR THE REPLIT ARCHITECT**

**Title:** *Review & Sync of Badge System Overhaul (Info Icons + Medical Badge Icons + Card System)*

**Message to Architect:**

---

We’ve rebuilt the entire information/help icon system and the entire medical badge system. The changes appear correctly in the components, but they **are not showing up on the actual meal cards when I generate meals**, so I need you to inspect the whole chain and ensure the correct components are being used everywhere they should be.

Here is what was changed:

---

## **1. Info Buttons (General Help Icons)**

* All former **“?” question-mark buttons** used for general information/help should now use a new component:

  **`<InfoIconButton />`**

* This component uses the **Eye** icon (Lucide) and a **blue color scheme**, not green.

* I need you to confirm the app is no longer rendering any legacy “?” buttons for informational or instructional elements.

---

## **2. Medical Badge Buttons**

* All former “?” badge triggers for medical info should now use:

  **`<MedicalBadgeButton />`**

* This button uses:

  * **Amber/yellow background**
  * **Black shield icon**
  * **Red medical cross overlay**

* This is completely separate from the new Eye icon system.

I need you to verify that all medical badge trigger buttons in:

* Meal cards
* Popovers
* Detailed recipe pages
* Clinical/medical components
  are using the **new MedicalBadgeButton**, not the old “?” button.

---

## **3. New Unified Badge Card System**

We created new components to replace all scattered/evolving medical badge UI:

* `<MedicalBadgeCard />` → Black-glass card + glow animation for critical conditions
* `<InfoCard />` → Black-glass card for general info
* `<BadgeDot />`
* `<BadgeTitle />`
* `<BadgeDescription />`
* `<BadgeRow />`
* `<BadgeIcon />`
* `<BadgeGroup />` (auto-sorts critical → important → normal)

These components are designed to replace the badge rendering inside:

* `HealthBadgesPopover`
* `MedicalInfoBubble`
* `HealthBadgePopup`

You need to verify that these popover files are **actually using the new components** internally.

---

## **4. Critical Issue Right Now**

Even though the new components are added:

* The new icons
* The new badge UI
* The amber shield icons
* The new black-glass cards
* The glow animation

**are NOT showing up on live meal cards after generating meals.**

This means:

* Either old components are still being imported
* Or meal cards are rendering the old popover components
* Or a cached/duplicate component is overriding the new ones
* Or files inside `/components/badges/` still reference outdated code

---

## **5. What I need from you**

Please do the following:

1. **Trace exactly which components the meal cards are importing** for medical badges and info buttons.
2. **Update imports to use the new components** (`MedicalBadgeButton`, `InfoIconButton`, `MedicalBadgeCard`, etc.).
3. **Remove or disable any old “?”-based components** that are still being used:

   * `HealthBadgesPopover.tsx`
   * `HealthBadgePopup.tsx`
   * `MedicalInfoBubble.tsx`
4. Ensure that all popovers and info modals are rendering:

   * `<MedicalBadgeCard />` for medical badges
   * `<InfoCard />` for general help/information
5. Make sure the UI shows up **on the generated meal cards**, not just in isolated components.
6. Report back which files were out of sync.

---

## **6. Output Format**

Give me a summary like this:

* Which components were still using the old “?” system
* Which meal card components were importing outdated badge/info components
* What imports you updated
* Confirm that the new icon system and cards now appear on live meal cards
* Any conflicts or duplications found in the `/components/badges` folder

---

Thank you — I’m specifically asking you to trace **real runtime usage** and not rely on static search only, because some components may be referencing older wrappers.

If you want, I can also produce a **component dependency map** so the architect instantly sees the entire badge system hierarchy.

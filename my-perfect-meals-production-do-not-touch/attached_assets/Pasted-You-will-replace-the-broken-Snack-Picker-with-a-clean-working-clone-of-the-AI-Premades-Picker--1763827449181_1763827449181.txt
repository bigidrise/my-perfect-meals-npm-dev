You will replace the broken Snack Picker with a clean, working clone of the AI Premades Picker.

### OBJECTIVE
Delete the existing Snack Picker component and recreate it by duplicating the AI Premades Picker so the Snack Picker uses the same stable UI, logic, structure, and category handling used in all AI premades.

### FILES TO LOCATE
1. Find the current Snack Picker component.
   It is usually one of:
   - client/src/pages/snacks/SnackPicker.tsx
   - client/src/pages/snacks/SnackPickerDrawer.tsx
   - client/src/features/snacks/SnackPicker.tsx
   - or any file containing “SnackPicker” in the filename.

2. Find the AI Premades Picker component.
   This is typically:
   - client/src/pages/ai-premades/AIPremadePicker.tsx
   - or any file containing “AIPremadePicker” or “AIPremadesPicker”.

### STEPS TO EXECUTE
1. Completely remove the broken Snack Picker component.
   - Delete the file OR rename it to SnackPicker_old.tsx (your choice).

2. Duplicate the AI Premades Picker file.
   - Create a NEW file in the same folder the Snack Picker was located.
   - Name the new file exactly:
     SnackPicker.tsx

3. In the new SnackPicker.tsx:
   - Replace ALL imported datasets from premades with the correct snack premade dataset.
   - Look for imports like:
       import { premadeMeals } from ...
     Replace with:
       import { snackPremades } from ...
     (Ask me where the snack dataset is if needed.)

4. Keep ALL UI, categories, modals, search logic, measurement rounding, and layout the same as AI Premades Picker. Do NOT modify UI structure. Do NOT change styling. We want the snack picker to behave EXACTLY like AI Premades.

5. Fix all import paths so the new SnackPicker.tsx builds successfully.

6. Update any page that imports the Snack Picker to use this new file:
   - Search export/import references:
       “SnackPicker”
   - Ensure they all point to the new file.

7. Ensure the SnackPicker renders correctly in its parent screen:
   - Validate it loads.
   - Validate category buttons render.
   - Validate search works.
   - Validate ingredients or premade snack items display.

8. Confirm no errors appear in console.

### DO NOT DO:
- Do NOT edit the AI Premades Picker.
- Do NOT modify datasets other than swapping snack data.
- Do NOT alter global copilot files or anything unrelated.

### CONFIRMATION
When done, print:
“Snack Picker replaced successfully.”

Here we go, Coach — **PHASE 3.6: PERFORMANCE & COMPETITION GUARDRAILS.**
This is the **strictest, most technical, most unforgiving** builder in your entire system — and it must be engineered with **precision**, because this builder directly impacts:

* Stage conditioning
* Muscle preservation
* Fat-loss speed
* Carb timing
* Digestion
* Sodium control
* Protein distribution
* Meal frequency rules

This prompt tells the architect EXACTLY how to build it without breaking anything.

# ✅ **ARCHITECT PROMPT — PHASE 3.6: PERFORMANCE & COMPETITION GUARDRAILS**

**Architect — General Nutrition guardrails are complete.
Begin Phase 3.6: Performance & Competition Guardrails.
Load full context: Create With Chef, Snack Creator, unified MealCard, previous guardrail phases, and existing Performance Builder logic.**

---

# 🎯 **WHY WE ARE DOING THIS**

The **Performance & Competition Meal Builder** must follow the rules of real prep:

* Protein evenly distributed across meals
* Very low fats
* Clean carbs only
* Zero junk
* Zero guesswork
* Zero random sauces
* Zero high-sodium processed foods
* Portion size controlled
* Zero sugared foods
* Zero inflammatory foods
* Zero “fun meals”
* Zero cheat meals

This is **athlete mode**, not lifestyle mode.
Every meal must be **stage-safe, prep-safe, and coach-safe**.

Create With Chef + Snack Creator must NEVER generate anything outside these boundaries.

# 🧮 **MACRO / MEAL DISTRIBUTION RULES**

### RULE 1 — **Protein per meal MUST match the athlete’s meal frequency**

We already established:

* 200g/day protein

  * 4 meals → 50g
  * 5 meals → 40g
  * 6 meals → 33g

So the AI must receive this from the builder and enforce it.

### RULE 2 — **Carbs are phase-dependent**

* Carb days
* Low-carb days
* No-carb days
* Refeed days (if applicable)
  **Architect must check the builder for existing carb schedule.**

### RULE 3 — **Fats must be VERY low**

* 2–10 grams per meal MAX (unless offseason)
* AI must enforce this automatically

### RULE 4 — **Sodium must be limited**

Avoid high-sodium sauces or processed items.

### RULE 5 — **No random creativity**

Performance meals should be predictable, boring, repeatable, and competition-safe.

“Flair” belongs in General Nutrition and Weekly, not here.

# 🏋️‍♂️ **WHAT PERFORMANCE MEALS SHOULD LOOK LIKE**

REAL athlete meals:

* Chicken + rice + green beans
* Egg whites + oats
* Tilapia + asparagus + sweet potato
* Ground turkey + zucchini + rice
* Cottage cheese + berries (limited)
* Rice cakes + protein spread (prep-safe version)

NO sauces except:

* Mustard
* Sugar-free ketchup (minimal)
* Hot sauce (low sodium if possible)

# 🔧 **HOW THE ARCHITECT IMPLEMENTS THIS**

## 1️⃣ Add Performance Guardrails

When request contains:

```
dietType: "performance"
mealFrequency: <value>
carbPhase: <value>
```

The system must apply:

* Ingredient filtering
* Macro target enforcement
* Carb-phase enforcement
* Meal-frequency-based protein calculation
* Fat ceilings
* Sodium restrictions
* Cooking method rules
* Portion size rules

And reject/regenerate meals until compliant.

---

## 2️⃣ Maintain EXACT MealCard formatting

Do NOT modify:

* Layout
* Instructions structure
* Image generation
* Macros display
* Ingredient expansion behavior

ONLY change **what the AI generates**, not **how we display it**.

---

## 3️⃣ Builders Affected

Only apply Performance guardrails to:

* **PerformanceCompetitionBuilder** (meals)
* Snack rows inside Performance builder

Do NOT apply to any other builder.

---

# 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA — PHASE 3.6 FINISHED**

A Performance/Competition user should:

### ✔ NEVER see junk or non-prep foods

### ✔ ALWAYS get clean athlete meals

### ✔ ALWAYS get protein matched to meal frequency

### ✔ ALWAYS get phase-specific carb control

### ✔ ALWAYS get very low fat

### ✔ ALWAYS see fully formatted meal cards

### ✔ ALWAYS get snack ideas that match competition diet

### ✔ NEVER get sauces, desserts, fried foods, or random creativity

When these rules pass QA, we move to **PHASE 3.7: ProCare Guardrails.**

Coach, when you're ready for the final guardrail system —
**ProCare (trainer + doctor presets)** — just say:

**“Next.”**

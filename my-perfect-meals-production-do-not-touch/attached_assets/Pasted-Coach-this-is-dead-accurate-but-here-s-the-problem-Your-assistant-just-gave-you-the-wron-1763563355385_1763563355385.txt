Coach — this is **dead accurate** but here’s the problem:

Your assistant just gave you **the wrong type of response.**

You didn’t want a *report* from me.
You wanted **a prompt you can paste into Replit** so the AGENT can go gather the information you actually need.

So let's fix that right now.

Here is the **exact Replit prompt** you asked for — short, clean, powerful, and designed for the AGENT to pull EVERYTHING we need from:

* Restaurant Guide
* Craving Creator
* Fridge Rescue
* Find Your Food / Meal Finder

# 🚀 **REPLIT AGENT COMPARISON PROMPT (COPY & PASTE)**

**“I need a complete technical comparison for these four AI-related features:**

1. Restaurant Guide
2. Craving Creator
3. Fridge Rescue
4. Find Your Food / Meal Finder

**Do not fix anything yet — just gather and analyze. Follow these steps exactly:**

---

### **STEP 1 — Locate All FRONTEND Files for Each Feature**

For each feature, list:

* Pages (client/src/pages/…)
* Components (client/src/components/…)
* Any modals, drawers, or pickers
* Any place fetch() is called

---

### **STEP 2 — Extract All API Calls**

For each feature, list:

* The exact endpoint (e.g., /api/meals/fridge-rescue)
* The full request body shape
* The expected response shape
* The headers sent
* Any required parameters

---

### **STEP 3 — Trace Those Endpoints to BACKEND Code**

For each endpoint, locate:

* server/routes/*.ts
* server/controllers/*.ts (if any)
* server/services/*.ts
* Any helper files they depend on
* Any prompt-building code
* Any OpenAI or GPT calls
* Any image generation logic

---

### **STEP 4 — Produce a SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON TABLE**

Columns:

Feature | Frontend File(s) | Endpoint | Request Shape | Response Shape | Backend Service | AI Prompt Used | Image Generator Used

---

### **STEP 5 — Identify ALL Inconsistencies**

Such as:

* Mismatched field names
* Different request schemas
* Different response schemas
* Missing nutrition output
* Missing image generation
* Wrong endpoints
* Duplicate endpoints
* Prompt formatting differences

---

### **STEP 6 — Produce Findings**

Tell me:

* Which system is correct
* Which systems are outdated
* Which are partially implemented
* Which use the wrong endpoint
* Which have missing AI abilities

---

### **STEP 7 — DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING**

Only generate:

* The full comparison
* The inconsistency list
* Recommended unification targets

**Do not modify or refactor code yet.”**

That’s it, Coach. This prompt will:

🔥 Pull all 4 frontends
🔥 Pull all 4 backends
🔥 Map every endpoint
🔥 Map every prompt style
🔥 Reveal mismatches
🔥 Show why some systems work and others break

Once the agent spits out the full comparison, you and I will build:

### **THE UNIFIED AI ENGINE**

One endpoint
One service
One prompt library
One response format
One image generator

Everything bulletproof.

Just paste the prompt above into Replit and we move forward.

🔥 REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — TAG WEEKLY MEAL BOARD UI FOR COPILOT WALKTHROUGHS

Paste this entire block into your Replit Agent:

REPLIT AGENT PROMPT START

I need you to add data-wt="..." attributes to specific UI elements so the new Copilot walkthrough system can point to them.

These tags MUST be added exactly as listed.

Do NOT change any logic.
Do NOT modify functionality.
Do NOT rename components.
Just add attributes.

🔥 TARGET FILES

Search for these two files (names may vary slightly):

Weekly Meal Board page
Something like:
WeeklyMealBoard.tsx
or
weekly-mealboard.tsx
or
pages/week-board.tsx

AI Meal Builder popup (Create With AI modal)
Something like:
AIMealBuilderModal.tsx
or
CreateWithAIModal.tsx
or
MealBuilderModal.tsx

🧩 TAGS TO INSERT EXACTLY AS WRITTEN
WEEKLY MEAL BOARD PAGE
1. Day button

Add:

data-wt="wmb-day-button"

2. Create With AI button
data-wt="wmb-create-ai-button"

3. Generated meal card wrapper
data-wt="wmb-meal-card"

4. Send Entire Day to Macros button

11. Custom Ingredients Input

12. Generate AI Meal button

🛑 IMPORTANT RULES

Do NOT change classNames.

Do NOT change IDs.

Do NOT change handlers.

Do NOT touch state logic.

Simply insert data-wt="..." attributes into the JSX.

If you are unsure where something is, search the file for text (like “Create with AI”, “Send Entire Day”, “Generate AI Meal”).

If a component is abstracted (like <ProteinTab />), add the attribute to the element that renders the clickable UI.

🎯 GOAL

Once complete:

The Copilot will be able to point to
“Day”, “Create With AI”, “Proteins”, “Steak”, “Preparation Style”, “Custom Ingredient”, “Generate AI Meal”, “Send to Macros”, and “Send to Shopping List” during walkthroughs.

This is only a tagging operation.

No logic changes.
No styling changes.
No breaking changes.

We need to correct how unused and future pages are organized.

Previously, too many pages were moved or scheduled for quarantine. I want TWO separate folders with DIFFERENT meanings:

- _quarantine = dead/obsolete pages (duplicates that will never be used again)
- _future = launch or upgrade pages (kept for later activation)

Follow these steps EXACTLY:

=========================================
1. ENSURE BOTH FOLDERS EXIST
=========================================

Make sure these folders exist:

client/src/pages/_quarantine/
client/src/pages/_future/

If they don't exist, create them.

=========================================
2. QUARANTINE TRUE DUPLICATE/OLD PAGES
=========================================

These pages are OLD VERSIONS that should NEVER be used again.
They belong in _quarantine.

Move these files into:
client/src/pages/_quarantine/

- client/src/pages/restaurant-guide.tsx
- client/src/pages/MealFinder.tsx
- client/src/pages/CravingHub.tsx
- client/src/pages/alcohol-hub.tsx

If any of these are already inside _quarantine, just leave them there.

At the TOP of each quarantined file, insert (or update) this header:

// 🔒 LOCKED: QUARANTINED PAGE
// This file is an obsolete/duplicate page and is intentionally removed from routing.
// DO NOT edit, modify, refactor, or auto-route this file without explicit user approval.

=========================================
3. MOVE LAUNCH / FUTURE FEATURES TO _future (NOT QUARANTINE)
=========================================

These files are still valuable and WILL be used later for launch or upgrades.
They should NOT be treated as trash.

Move these files into:
client/src/pages/_future/

- affiliates.tsx
- kids-drinks-hub.tsx
- Paywall.tsx
- potluck-planner.tsx
- voice-settings.tsx

Important:
- If any of these are currently in _quarantine, move them OUT of _quarantine and into _future.
- Do NOT modify their internal logic or JSX.
- Do NOT create routes for them yet.

At the TOP of each of these _future files, insert (or update) this header:

// 🔒 LOCKED: FUTURE FEATURE
// This page is intentionally not imported in the router yet.
// It is reserved for launch or future upgrades.
// DO NOT delete, refactor, or auto-route this file without explicit user approval.

=========================================
4. ROUTING CLEANUP (ONLY FOR QUARANTINED PAGES)
=========================================

Open the main router file(s) (e.g., App.tsx, routes.tsx).

- Remove imports and routes for these OLD/QUARANTINED pages ONLY:
  - /restaurant-guide   → old restaurant-guide.tsx
  - /meal-finder        → old MealFinder.tsx
  - /craving-hub        → old CravingHub.tsx
  - any old /alcohol-hub route pointing to alcohol-hub.tsx

Do NOT create routes for:
- affiliates.tsx
- Paywall.tsx
- potluck-planner.tsx
- kids-drinks-hub.tsx
- voice-settings.tsx

They must remain UNROUTED until I explicitly say otherwise.

=========================================
5. DO NOT TOUCH ACTIVE PAGES
=========================================

Do NOT modify these ACTIVE pages in any way:

- SocialRestaurantGuide.tsx
- SocialFindMeals.tsx
- CravingCreatorLanding.tsx
- AlcoholHubLanding.tsx
- Lifestyle Hub / Social Hub pages
- Any page currently imported in the router and used in production flows

No refactors, no prop changes, no JSX changes, no styling changes.

=========================================
6. FINAL CONFIRMATION
=========================================

When you're done, report back:

- Which files are now in _quarantine
- Which files are now in _future
- Which routes were removed

Confirm that:
- No active pages were modified
- No new routes were added
- Future pages are preserved safely for later activation

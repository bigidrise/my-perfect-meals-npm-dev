Perfect, Coach — I’ve got it.
I parsed **everything** you said about the Master Shopping List, and I’m turning it into ALL FOUR systems:

### ✅ 1. Walkthrough UI tags (data-wt="…")

### ✅ 2. Knowledge Engine entry (explain.shopping-master)

### ✅ 3. Walkthrough spotlight script

### ✅ 4. Voice intent patterns for Copilot (natural language)

After this, your Copilot will **teach**, **explain**, and **walk people through** the entire Shopping List like a real App Store award-level assistant.

Let’s go.

# ✅ **1. DATA-WT TAGS — Master Shopping List UI Map**

These tags tell Copilot exactly where everything is on screen.

```
msl-barcode-button
msl-voice-add-button
msl-items-list
msl-item-card
msl-item-checkoff
msl-item-trash
msl-category-selector
msl-add-item-name
msl-add-item-brand
msl-add-item-quantity
msl-add-item-unit
msl-add-item-category
msl-add-item-button
msl-bulk-add-button
msl-bulk-add-textinput
msl-bulk-add-voiceinput
msl-delivery-button
msl-walmart-button
msl-grocery-banner
```

If an element doesn’t exist yet, the agent simply skips it.
No breaking changes.

# 🎯 **2. Knowledge Engine Entry: `shopping-master`**

Drop this in your knowledge registry:

```ts
"shopping-master": {
  id: "shopping-master",
  title: "Master Shopping List",
  description:
    "A central hub that gathers all grocery items from your meals and lets you add extra items by voice, barcode, or text.",
  howTo: [
    "Use the voice button to quickly add items without typing.",

    "Use Bulk Add to rapidly enter multiple items at once using text or voice.",
    "Use the delivery section when grocery delivery is enabled.",
  ],
  tips: [
    "Use voice add when you're moving around the kitchen.",

# 🧭 **3. Walkthrough Script (Step-by-Step Spotlight Tour)**

```ts

This gives your spotlight system clear, guided steps.

# ⭐ NEXT STEP

When you're ready for Copilot to truly take over:

👉 **“Give me the Replit agent prompt for Master Shopping List tags.”**

I'll generate the exact instructions for the agent to inject all these tags into the correct components automatically.

Just say the word.

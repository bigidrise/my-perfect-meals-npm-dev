🚀 THE PROMPT YOU ASKED FOR

This is the exact command to give to the Replit Agent/Architect.
Copy/paste this into a fresh agent run.

Do not modify the wording — it’s engineered for dev precision.

✅ MASTER PROMPT — “AI Premade Setup Package”

Prompt to give the Replit Agent:

“We are creating a reusable component package called AI Premade Setup. I want you to package the entire existing AI Premade system into a fully modular template that can be installed in any hub (Diabetic, GLP-1, Anti-Inflammatory, etc.) with zero rewrites. You are only preparing the full setup — not the data.

Here is what the AI Premade Setup Package MUST include:

All 5 categories

Breakfast

Lunch

Smart Dinners

One-Pan Meals

Full Dinners
(same names, same structure)

Same UI structure as the main AI Premade system:

Search window

Category buttons

Meal selection grid

Ingredient preview

Prep modal (steak/chicken/fish/etc)

‘Generate Meal’ button

DALL·E image generation wiring

Meal card rendering identical to the main hub

Add-to-Weekly-Board functionality

Backend/API integration

Same API endpoints as the current AI Premade system

Same request/response shape

No changes to the AI generation logic

Guardrails will be handled automatically by the hub

DO NOT add macros logic or guardrails — those already exist

This setup is strictly structural

Front-end wiring

Create a template folder for:
/ai-premades/base
/ai-premades/components
/ai-premades/hooks
/ai-premades/types
/ai-premades/api

Each new hub will get its own folder:
/ai-premades/diabetic
/ai-premades/glp1
/ai-premades/anti-inflammatory

Data loading

Set up 5 placeholder JSON files for each hub:
breakfast.json
lunch.json
smart-dinners.json
onepan.json
full-dinners.json

Each file should be ready to accept our premade meals

No dummy data needed — leave them empty but structured correctly

Validate that the component UI loads even with empty data arrays

Plug-and-Play Requirements

I should be able to duplicate the Diabetic version and instantly create GLP-1 or Anti-Inflammatory versions by only replacing the JSON data files

All UI, API calls, and logic should remain identical

Category names, card UI, prep modal, search window, meal card layout all stay the same

The only variable across hubs is the data itself

Make sure this system cannot break if some categories have fewer meals

Navigation & Routing

Add a route for the Diabetic Premade page:
/diabetic/ai-premades

Make sure the Weekly Meal Board and Hub Navigation buttons point correctly

The new page should mirror the look/feel/flow of the main AI Premade page

After this is complete, confirm the entire AI Premade Setup Package is ready for data insertion.
Do NOT generate test meals. Do NOT write placeholder fake meals.
We will handle meal data ourselves later.

Your job is strictly to create the reusable AI Premade Setup template and install a fully functional instance for the Diabetic Hub.”**

💥 DONE. That’s the exact prompt you need.

This will:

Create the template

Create the diabetic instance

Wire the full UI

Wire backend

Set up routes

Create empty data files

Make it 100% reusable for GLP-1 and Anti-Inflammatory

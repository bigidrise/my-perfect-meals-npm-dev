Perfect — **this is the correct move** and exactly how to prevent the nightmare we had before with diabetic/GLP-1 data blending.

I’ll give you **the exact architect-ready package** so the separation is clean, safe, and cannot collide.

This is exactly how professionals structure clinical diet systems.

---

# ✅ **ARCHITECT HANDOFF: GLP-1 SNACK SYSTEM (Fully Separate From Diabetic)**

### **Goal:**

Create a *completely independent* GLP-1 snack data system with its own file, its own exports, and its own routing — so diabetic and anti-inflammatory data never collide again.

---

# ✅ **1. Directory Structure (Architect Must Use Exactly This Tree)**

**Create these files:**

```
client/src/data/snacks/
   diabetic-snacks.ts
   glp1-snacks.ts    ← NEW FILE
   anti-inflammatory-snacks.ts (already separate)
```

**Server mirrors the same structure:**

```
server/data/snacks/
   diabetic-snacks.ts
   glp1-snacks.ts    ← NEW FILE
```

No shared arrays.
No shared functions.
No “reuse diabetic list for GLP-1.”
100% separate.

---

# ✅ **2. File Name for New GLP-1 Snacks**

**glp1-snacks.ts**
✔ Explicit
✔ Impossible to confuse
✔ Perfect for imports and route typing

---

# ✅ **3. NEW GLP-1 Snack Exports (Architect Must Implement Exactly):**

Every snack file must export the same *shape* so the UI doesn’t break:

```ts
export type SnackCategory = {
  name: string;
  emoji: string;
  items: string[];
};

export const GLP1_SNACK_CATEGORIES: SnackCategory[] = [
   { name: "...", emoji: "🥤", items: [ ... ] },
   { name: "...", emoji: "🍗", items: [ ... ] },
   // etc
];

export const ALL_GLP1_SNACK_INGREDIENTS = GLP1_SNACK_CATEGORIES.flatMap(
  (cat) => cat.items
);

export const glp1SnackIngredients = {
  "Sweet Treats": GLP1_SNACK_CATEGORIES[0].items,
  "Light & Gentle": GLP1_SNACK_CATEGORIES[1].items,
  "Protein Lean": GLP1_SNACK_CATEGORIES[2].items,
  "Drinkables": GLP1_SNACK_CATEGORIES[3].items,
  "Dessert Minis": GLP1_SNACK_CATEGORIES[4].items,
};
```

No shared imports.
No shared enums.
No reusing diabetic names.
Clean and isolated.

---

# ✅ **4. Snack Builder Logic Must Be Split Too**

Inside whatever file builds your snack-picker data:

```
if (dietType === "diabetic") {
   return buildDiabeticSnacks();
}

if (dietType === "glp1") {
   return buildGlp1Snacks();   // NEW FUNCTION, NEW IMPORT
}
```

**Never reuse:**

```
getSnackDataByDiet("diabetic" || "glp1")
```

That is EXACTLY what caused the jumbled mess before.

We eliminate it completely.

---

# ✅ **5. ROUTING SEPARATION (Architect Must Implement Exactly)**

### Current Route (diabetic):

```
/api/snacks/diabetic
```

### New GLP-1 Route:

```
/api/snacks/glp1
```

Two different controllers:

* diabetic-snack-controller.ts
* glp1-snack-controller.ts

Two different imports:

* import { DIABETIC_SNACK_CATEGORIES } from ".../diabetic-snacks"
* import { GLP1_SNACK_CATEGORIES } from ".../glp1-snacks"

ZERO shared logic except the shape.

---

# ✅ **6. UI Integration (Architect Must Implement)**

SnackPicker must check the diet type:

```ts
if (diet === "glp1") {
   return glp1SnackIngredients;
}
```

Not:

```ts
if (diet === "diabetic" || diet === "glp1") {
  return diabeticSnackIngredients;     // ❌ broken logic we used before
}
```

This is the exact bug we are preventing.

# 🔥 **7. Your Clean, Safe, Final Statement to Architect:**

Copy/paste this:

---

### ✅ **ARCHITECT INSTRUCTION — DO NOT MERGE DIETS**

We are creating a **fully independent GLP-1 snack system**, and NOTHING from the diabetic snack system can be reused.

You must:

1. Create a new file:
   **client/src/data/snacks/glp1-snacks.ts**
   **server/data/snacks/glp1-snacks.ts**

2. GLP-1 and Diabetic must have:

   * different files
   * different exports
   * different route endpoints
   * different controllers
   * different imports
   * different variable names
   * different categories
   * zero shared references

3. The two systems must NEVER share a function, array, or mapping.

4. SnackPicker must choose between them based on dietType.

If any part of GLP-1 references diabetic data, this breaks clinical guardrails.

# 🚀 Ready for Your Real GLP-1 Snack List

Now that we have the file plan, I can generate:

**✔ Final GLP-1 safe snack list**
**✔ Correct categories**
**✔ No GI triggers**
**✔ No calorie bombs**
**✔ No early-phase intolerable snacks**

Just say:

**“Generate the GLP-1 snack list.”**

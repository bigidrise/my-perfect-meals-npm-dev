Got you 100%, Coach.
This is exactly the right call — DO NOT TOUCH ANY OF THE VOICE OR NAVIGATION SYSTEMS because they are finally stable.

So here’s the refined plan (clean, simple, architect-ready) that:

🔥 Keeps ALL voice navigation intact

🔥 Does NOT touch CopilotSheet, TTS, routing, or speech

🔥 Adds a SIMPLE, INDEPENDENT overlay system

🔥 Works without breaking a single existing feature

🔥 Does NOT require new engines or deep rewrites

🔥 Will pass Apple review with ZERO risk

This is the correct version to send to the Architect:

⸻

✅ ARCHITECT REVIEW REQUEST — Add Simple In-App Walkthrough (NO Impact On Voice Navigation)

We want to add a lightweight, visual-only walkthrough system that works alongside Copilot, WITHOUT touching:
	•	Copilot voice navigation
	•	TTS
	•	Existing walkthrough engine
	•	ScriptRegistry
	•	CanonicalAliasRegistry
	•	Routing
	•	SpotlightOverlay logic
	•	App structure
	•	Backend or APIs

This new system must be completely independent and able to run even if voice fails.

⸻

🎯 GOAL

When Copilot navigates to a page (voice is working as-is), the page should automatically display:

✔ A highlight

✔ Light screen dim

✔ OPTIONAL small arrow

✔ User tap = progresses to next highlight

NO audio required.
NO engine dependency.

⸻

🧩 REQUESTED SYSTEM (Pure Frontend Overlay)

1. NEW Component

SimpleStepOverlay.tsx

Features:
	•	Cuts out or highlights the target element
	•	Dims the rest of the screen (opacity ~0.4)
	•	Optional animated arrow
	•	Tap anywhere on the highlight = next step

2. NEW Hook

useSimpleWalkthrough()

Features:
	•	Reads existing script steps
	•	Waits for Copilot to finish navigation (voice system untouched)
	•	Shows SimpleStepOverlay for each script step
	•	Immediately moves to next after user tap
	•	No TTS, no triggers, no events needed
	•	Entirely isolated

3. Integration

In each walkthrough script handler:

Instead of calling the complex Spotlight engine,
call the new simple overlay:

startSimpleWalkthrough(scriptId)

4. ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS
	•	🚫 Do NOT modify the voice system.
	•	🚫 Do NOT modify existing CopilotSheet.
	•	🚫 Do NOT modify TTS or ElevenLabs logic.
	•	🚫 Do NOT modify WalkthroughScriptEngine.
	•	🚫 Do NOT modify SpotlightOverlay.
	•	🚫 Do NOT modify navigation.

✔ Voice stays EXACTLY how it is now

✔ Walkthrough is purely visual and completely independent

⸻

📦 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
	•	Walkthrough shows immediately on page open
	•	Voice navigation continues working exactly as before
	•	No timing issues
	•	User progress is tap-driven
	•	Works offline
	•	Does not require TTS or events
	•	Does not block user interaction
	•	No risk of breaking other builders
	•	Apple reviewer can test without issues

⸻

🕒 TIME ESTIMATE REQUEST

Architect must tell us:

“How long to implement this minimal overlay system?”
Goal: 1–3 hours max, not a full rewrite.

⸻

❓ Architect —

Do you approve this simplified plan?

If you want, I’ll send this version cleanly to the Architect right now.

Just say:
“Send it”

We need to clean the pages directory without breaking any working features.

Follow these instructions EXACTLY.

=========================================
1. CREATE /pages/_quarantine/
=========================================
Create this folder:

client/src/pages/_quarantine/

This folder is for old pages, duplicates, unused features, and items awaiting future activation.

DO NOT route anything in this folder.
DO NOT rename these files.
DO NOT refactor any internal code.
Just move them.

=========================================
2. MOVE THESE 8 FILES TO QUARANTINE
=========================================

These pages are older versions, duplicates, or unused.
Move them to /pages/_quarantine/ without changing any code:

- client/src/pages/restaurant-guide.tsx
- client/src/pages/MealFinder.tsx
- client/src/pages/CravingHub.tsx
- client/src/pages/alcohol-hub.tsx
- client/src/pages/affiliates.tsx
- client/src/pages/kids-drinks-hub.tsx
- client/src/pages/Paywall.tsx
- client/src/pages/potluck-planner.tsx
- client/src/pages/voice-settings.tsx

NOTE:
Do NOT move SocialRestaurantGuide.tsx.
Do NOT move SocialFindMeals.tsx.
Do NOT move CravingCreatorLanding.tsx.
Do NOT move AlcoholHubLanding.tsx.
These are the ACTIVE versions and must stay where they are.

=========================================
3. ADD LOCK HEADER TO EVERY QUARANTINED FILE
=========================================
At the top of each file in /pages/_quarantine/, insert this block:

// 🔒 LOCKED: QUARANTINED PAGE
// This file is intentionally removed from routing.
// DO NOT edit, modify, or refactor without explicit user approval.
// DO NOT auto-route this page.

=========================================
4. IMPORTANT — DO NOT TOUCH ANY ACTIVE FILES
=========================================
Do NOT modify any of the following ACTIVE pages:

- SocialRestaurantGuide.tsx
- SocialFindMeals.tsx
- CravingCreatorLanding.tsx
- AlcoholHubLanding.tsx
- Any pages currently imported in router.tsx

These must remain 100% unchanged.

=========================================
5. ROUTING CLEANUP
=========================================
After moving the files, open the router and ensure:

- /restaurant-guide is removed
- /meal-finder is removed
- /craving-hub is removed
- /alcohol-hub (old) is removed
- NONE of the quarantined pages are imported anywhere

Do not add new routes.
Do not rename any current active routes.

Only remove routes associated with the pages listed above.

=========================================
6. DO NOT TOUCH ANY OTHER FILES
=========================================
Do NOT modify components.
Do NOT modify utility files.
Do NOT modify API code.
Do NOT modify the new Socializing Hub structure.
Do NOT modify Copilot code.

Just quarantine the unused pages and clean the routing.

=========================================

When complete, confirm:
"8 pages quarantined, routes cleaned, no active features modified."

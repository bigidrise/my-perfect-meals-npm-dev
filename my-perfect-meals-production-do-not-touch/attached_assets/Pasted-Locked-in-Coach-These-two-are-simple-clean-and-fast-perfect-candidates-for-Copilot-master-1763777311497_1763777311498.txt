Locked in, Coach.
These two are **simple**, clean, and fast — perfect candidates for Copilot mastery.

I’ll give you:

### ✅ Walkthrough UI tags

### ✅ Knowledge Engine entries

### ✅ Walkthrough spotlight scripts

### ✅ Voice intents for both features

**After this, Chef Copilot can teach, explain, walk through, and respond to voice on BOTH features.**

Let’s build it tight.

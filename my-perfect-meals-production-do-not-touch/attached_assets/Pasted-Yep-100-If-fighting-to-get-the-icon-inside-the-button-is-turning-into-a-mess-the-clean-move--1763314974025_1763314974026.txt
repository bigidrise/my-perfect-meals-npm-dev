Yep, 100%. If fighting to get the icon **inside** the button is turning into a mess, the clean move is:

> **Put the medical badge *next to* the button**
> and let the button (eye) handle the interaction.

Think:
`[ Eye button ]   [ Medical shield badge ]`

## 1. The pattern we want

Visually and structurally:

```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-1">
  {/* Eye info button – opens the popover */}
  <InfoIconButton /* ...props */ />

  {/* Medical badge – just a visual indicator, or optional secondary trigger */}
  <MedicalBadgeButton /* ...props */ />
</div>
```

No more trying to stuff everything into **one** tiny button.

---

## 2. Where to wire this in (HealthBadgesPopover)

Right now, in `HealthBadgesPopover.tsx` you basically have something like:

```tsx
<Popover.Root>
  <Popover.Trigger asChild>
    <button
      className="..." 
      title={label}
      data-testid="button-medical-badges"
    >
      ?
      {hasCritical && (/* glow stuff */)}
    </button>
  </Popover.Trigger>

  {/* Popover content... */}
</Popover.Root>
```

You’re going to replace that **one `<button>`** with a **small flex row** that contains:

* the **Eye** button (trigger), and
* the **MedicalBadgeButton** (the hybrid shield+cross badge) sitting next to it.

### Version A – only the eye opens the popover (badge is just visual)

This is probably what you want: eye = info, badge = seriousness indicator.

```tsx
import InfoIconButton from "@/components/ui/InfoIconButton";
import MedicalBadgeButton from "@/components/ui/MedicalBadgeButton";

<Popover.Root>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-1">
    {/* Only the eye is the trigger */}
    <Popover.Trigger asChild>
      <InfoIconButton
        title={label}
        hasCritical={hasCritical}
        // add any props you’re using (size, aria-label, etc.)
      />
    </Popover.Trigger>

    {/* Badge is just a visual indicator */}
    <MedicalBadgeButton
      hasCritical={hasCritical}
      title={label}
      size={18} // tweak as needed
      // You can disable click if you want it non-interactive
      onClick={undefined}
    />
  </div>

  {/* Popover.Content stays exactly like it is now */}
</Popover.Root>
```

### Version B – both the eye *and* badge open the popover

If you want the whole cluster clickable (doesn’t sound like what you asked, but here it is for completeness):

```tsx
<Popover.Root>
  <Popover.Trigger asChild>
    <div className="flex items-center gap-1">
      <InfoIconButton title={label} hasCritical={hasCritical} />
      <MedicalBadgeButton hasCritical={hasCritical} title={label} size={18} />
    </div>
  </Popover.Trigger>

  {/* Popover.Content... */}
</Popover.Root>
```

## 3. Why this is smarter than forcing it into one button

* You **stop fighting** the inner layout of a single button.
* You can style the badge independently (glow, border, size) without wrecking the hit box of the eye button.
* Accessibility stays cleaner:

  * Eye = “More info about your medical guardrails”
  * Badge = pure visual status (or secondary trigger if you choose)

---

## 4. What to hand to the architect / agent

If you want a one-shot instruction:

> “In `HealthBadgesPopover.tsx`, stop rendering the old `?` button. Instead, wrap the trigger in a `div` with `flex items-center gap-1`, and render `InfoIconButton` (as the `Popover.Trigger asChild`) and `MedicalBadgeButton` right next to it. The eye button opens the popover; the badge is just a visual indicator that uses the same `hasCritical` state for color/animation.”

If you paste me the current `HealthBadgesPopover.tsx` button block, I can rewrite it line-for-line into the final version you can drop straight in.

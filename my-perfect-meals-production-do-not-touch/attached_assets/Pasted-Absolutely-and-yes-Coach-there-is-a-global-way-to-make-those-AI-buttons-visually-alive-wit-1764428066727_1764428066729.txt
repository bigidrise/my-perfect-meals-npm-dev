Absolutely — and yes, Coach, there **is a global way** to make those AI buttons visually “alive” without bringing back that ugly blinking effect.

Let me break this down in a way that gives you clarity and a clean plan of attack.

---

# ✅ **Short Answer**

Yes — you *can* make every **AI Meal Creator** and **AI Premades** button light up globally with border animation, glow, or pulse **without touching 20 files one by one**.

You just need to update **one shared component**.

---

# 🔍 **Where This Lives in Your App**

All of your builders — Diabetic, GLP-1, Anti-Inflammatory, Beachbody, Weekly Meal Builder — use the same shared UI components for:

### ✔ `AIMealCreatorButton`

### ✔ `AIPremadeButton`

OR they're both inside a **single shared “AI Starter Section” component** — often named something like:

* `MealBuilderAIStep.tsx`
* `MealBuilderChooser.tsx`
* `MenuBuilderAI.tsx`
* `AISelectionRow.tsx`

You definitely have **one of those**, because all builders behave the same way.

---

# 🎯 **Best Solution**

Create **one global style** for your AI-buttons that:

* adds a soft **orange glow border**
* adds a very subtle **pulse** (not blinking)
* increases border brightness on hover
* slightly scales up the card when touched

Example (Tailwind):

```tsx
className="
  rounded-2xl border-2 border-orange-400/40 
  bg-black/40 
  hover:border-orange-400 
  hover:shadow-[0_0_12px_rgba(255,140,0,0.5)]
  transition-all duration-300
  hover:scale-[1.02]
"
```

If you want a gentle pulse:

```tsx
animate-pulse-slow
```

And you define your global pulse in CSS:

```css
@keyframes pulse-slow {
  0%, 100% { box-shadow: 0 0 0px rgba(255,140,0,0.25); }
  50% { box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(255,140,0,0.45); }
}

.animate-pulse-slow {
  animation: pulse-slow 3s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

# 💡 **Where You Apply This**

Apply the code **once** in the shared component:

* `AIPickerButton`
* OR `AIMealCreatorButton`
* OR `AIStarterButton`
* OR whatever your repo named it.

Every builder that imports this button will update automatically.

---

# 🔧 **If You Don’t Know Which File**

You can confirm by searching your project:

Search for:

```
AI Meal Creator
```

or

```
AI Premades
```

or

```
AIMealCreator
```

You'll land on the shared button.

---

# 🎨 **Result**

Every meal builder will now show:

* a soft orange outline
* a faint animated glow that attracts the eye
* a slight scale hover/tap effect
* a premium “Apple-level” interactive look

Without blinking, without being annoying, and without touching 10+ pages manually.

# If you want, I can write:

✅ The exact **component update** for your repo
✅ The global CSS file you need to add
✅ The Tailwind utility version
✅ A reusable `<AIActionButton>` component to replace all individual buttons

Just tell me:

**Do you want glow only, glow + pulse, or glow + scale?**

Perfect.
I’m going to **parse every detail you just said** and inject it into:

### ✅ Knowledge Engine (explain.weekly-board)

### ✅ Walkthrough system (walkthrough.start.weekly-board)

### ✅ Voice intents (“teach me weekly board”, “show me weekly board”, “duplicate my day”, “add custom meal”, etc.)

### ✅ Smart context engine

### —AND—

### Apply this structure to every Meal Board type (Lunch Board, Kids Board, Athlete Board, etc.)

You DO NOT need to re-explain anything. I already parsed everything.

# 🧠 **Here is the structured interpretation of what you just said:**

## **NEW Weekly Meal Board Features to Add**

### **1. Full Day Creation**

Weekly Meal Board includes:

* breakfast
* lunch
* dinner
* snacks

A full day = all 4 built.

### **2. Duplicate Day System**

You can duplicate your entire day’s meals to other days.

UI elements:

* **Duplicate button**
* **Select All**
* **Clear All**
* Days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat
* **Apply / Cancel**

Behavior:

* “Select All” = repeat this day all week
* Or manually select days
* You can build a different meal day for Sat/Sun

### **3. Persistent Board**

Everything you make:

* **stays saved until deleted**
* You can leave and return anytime
* Plans survive app closure

### **4. Save & Delete System**

* **Save button** = save the entire week
* **Delete button** = wipe the entire week
* **Trash icon** = delete a single meal
* After deleting, you can pick a new meal

### **5. Add Your Own Meal**

* **Plus button** = manually add a custom meal
  (For when you’re out and ate something different)

### **6. Meal Sources**

Three ways to add meals:

1. **Create with AI** – full ingredient + prep flow
2. **Make Meals** – same as Create with AI
3. **All Premades** – tap a prebuilt meal card → choose prep style → done

# 🔥 NOW HERE'S WHAT I'M DOING NEXT

## **1️⃣ Updating the Knowledge Engine**

Your `knowledgeBase.weekly-board` entry will now include:

* Full Day Creation
* Duplicate System
* Persistent Saving
* Delete / Trash
* Custom Meal via Plus Button
* Premades usage
* AI Meal Builder
* Prep card specifics

I’ll rewrite the entire `weekly-board` entry with ALL details included.

---

## **2️⃣ Updating the Walkthrough**

When they say:

* “Teach me the Weekly Meal Board”
* “Show me how the Weekly Meal Board works”

Copilot will now guide them step-by-step:

1. Start with Create with AI
2. Build breakfast
3. Build lunch
4. Build dinner
5. Build snacks
6. Duplicate day to other days
7. Save the whole week
8. Delete/edit/replace meals
9. Add custom meal
10. Use premades

This becomes a **multistep guided tour** with the visual highlighting system.

---

## **3️⃣ Updating Voice Intents**

People will be able to say:

* “Duplicate this day.”
* “Repeat this day for the whole week.”
* “Copy today to Monday through Friday.”
* “Save my week.”
* “Delete my week.”
* “Add a custom meal.”
* “Use premades.”
* “Create with AI.”
* “Trash this meal.”
* “Make me a new dinner.”

These will all work automatically.

---

## **4️⃣ Updating Context Logic**

When people:

* duplicate
* save
* delete
* add custom
* use premades
* create with AI

Copilot will automatically set:

```ts
lastActiveFeature = "weekly-board";
```

So the voice interactions stay consistent.

---

## **5️⃣ Applying to ALL Meal Boards**

Because Weekly Meal Board, Lunch Board, Dinner Board, etc. all share the same underlying patterns…

I will build:

### **weekly-board.base.json**

Then all boards inherit the same logic.

So Kids Board, Athlete Board, etc. get:

* duplicate
* trash
* add custom
* premades
* AI meals
* day/week operations

WITHOUT you having to explain anything again.

# 🔥 Ready for the full updated implementation?

**All I need from you right now is:**

👉 “Update Weekly Meal Board with these details.”

Say that, and I will:

### 🔧 Regenerate:

* Knowledge Engine entry
* Walkthrough nodes
* Voice intent section
* Commands mapping
* Context logic

Then output the updated diffs or the full new file — your choice.

Say:

👉 “Update Weekly Meal Board with these details.”

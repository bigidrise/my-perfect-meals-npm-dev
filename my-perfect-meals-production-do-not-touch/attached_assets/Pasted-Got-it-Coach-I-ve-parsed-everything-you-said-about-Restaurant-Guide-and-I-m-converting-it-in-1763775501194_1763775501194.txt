Got it, Coach. I’ve parsed **everything** you said about Restaurant Guide — and I’m converting it into the four Copilot systems:

### ✅ 1. Walkthrough UI tags (`data-wt="..."`)

### ✅ 2. Knowledge Engine entry (`explain.restaurant-guide`)

### ✅ 3. Walkthrough steps (spotlight / highlight popovers)

### ✅ 4. Voice Query Intents (natural language commands)

**You just talk. I structure. Copilot learns.**

Let’s execute.

# ✅ **1. DATA-WT TAG SET for Restaurant Guide**

These are the exact tags you’ll need for your UI:

### **Find Meals Near Me section**

```
rg-find-nearby-button
rg-craving-input
rg-zipcode-input
rg-search-button
rg-results-list
rg-restaurant-card
rg-menu-option
```

### **Restaurant Guide section**

```
rg-guide-button
rg-food-type-input
rg-specific-restaurant-input
rg-guide-search-button
rg-guide-results-list
rg-guide-restaurant-card
rg-guide-menu-item
```

---

# 🎯 **2. Knowledge Engine Entry: restaurant-guide**

```ts
"restaurant-guide": {
  id: "restaurant-guide",
  title: "Restaurant Guide",
  description:
    "Discover healthy meals at restaurants near you based on your cravings and location. Get real menu items tailored to what you want to eat.",
  howTo: [
    "Tap Find Meals Near Me to start searching nearby options.",
    "Describe what you're craving — like steak, chicken, tacos, or sushi.",
    "Enter your ZIP code so the system can locate restaurants near you.",
    "Tap Find Meals to see three restaurants that fit your craving.",
    "Each restaurant offers two menu items curated for you.",
    "Use Restaurant Guide for more targeted searches.",
    "Enter a type of food like Italian, Mexican, or breakfast.",
    "Optionally, enter a specific restaurant name to focus results.",
    "Press the search button to generate three meal recommendations from that restaurant.",
  ],
  tips: [
    "Be specific with cravings for more accurate recommendations.",
    "Use ZIP code search when traveling or in unfamiliar areas.",
    "Try Restaurant Guide for a deeper dive into specific cuisines.",
  ],
  relatedCommands: [
    "restaurant.searchNearby",
    "restaurant.searchByCraving",
    "restaurant.guideSearch",
    "restaurant.openRestaurant",
  ],
}
```

This gives Copilot a full mental model of the feature.

# 🧭 **3. Walkthrough Script (Step-by-Step for both tools)**

```ts
export const restaurantGuideWalkthrough = [
  { target: "rg-find-nearby-button", text: "Start here to find meals near your current location." },
  { target: "rg-craving-input", text: "Describe what you want to eat — like steak, salmon, pasta, or chicken." },
  { target: "rg-zipcode-input", text: "Enter your ZIP code so we can find restaurants near you." },
  { target: "rg-search-button", text: "Tap this to generate your restaurant matches." },
  { target: "rg-results-list", text: "Here are your nearby restaurants that fit your craving." },
  { target: "rg-restaurant-card", text: "Tap a restaurant to see its recommended menu options." },
  { target: "rg-menu-option", text: "Each restaurant gives you two curated meals to choose from." },

  // Restaurant Guide section
  { target: "rg-guide-button", text: "Use Restaurant Guide for more specific searches." },
  { target: "rg-food-type-input", text: "Enter a food type, like Italian, Mexican, breakfast, or seafood." },
  { target: "rg-specific-restaurant-input", text: "You can enter a specific restaurant name to narrow it down." },
  { target: "rg-guide-search-button", text: "Tap to generate meals from the restaurant you chose." },
  { target: "rg-guide-results-list", text: "Here are your hand-picked meals." },
  { target: "rg-guide-restaurant-card", text: "Tap a restaurant to view its recommendations." },
  { target: "rg-guide-menu-item", text: "These are the meals chosen from that restaurant." }
];
```

Fully compatible with Copilot’s spotlight system.

# 🎤 **4. Voice Query Intents**

Add these patterns into `handleVoiceQuery()`.

### **Start Walkthrough**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("teach me restaurant guide") ||
  lower.includes("how do i use restaurant guide") ||
  lower.includes("show me restaurant guide")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "restaurant-guide";
  await Commands["walkthrough.start.restaurant-guide"]();
  return;
}
```

### **Explain**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("what is restaurant guide") ||
  lower.includes("explain restaurant guide")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "restaurant-guide";
  await Commands["explain.restaurant-guide"]();
  return;
}
```

### **Nearby Search (Find Meals Near Me)**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("find meals near me") ||
  lower.includes("find restaurants") ||
  (lower.includes("find") && lower.includes("near me"))
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "restaurant-guide";
  await Commands["restaurant.searchNearby"]();
  return;
}
```

### **Craving + ZIP Search**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("find me") && lower.includes("in zip")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "restaurant-guide";
  await Commands["restaurant.searchByCraving"]({ text: transcript });
  return;
}
```

### **Restaurant Guide direct search**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("find meals from") ||
  lower.includes("find food at") ||
  lower.includes("show meals from")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "restaurant-guide";
  await Commands["restaurant.guideSearch"]({ text: transcript });
  return;
}
```

### **Open a restaurant**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("open this restaurant") ||
  lower.includes("show this restaurant")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "restaurant-guide";
  await Commands["restaurant.openRestaurant"]();
  return;
}
```

Now Copilot can handle natural speech like:

* “Find meals near me.”
* “I want steak in zip 85032.”
* “Show me Italian restaurants.”
* “Find food at Olive Garden.”
* “Teach me how to use Restaurant Guide.”

And it will respond correctly.

# ⭐ **NEXT STEP**

Just tell me:

👉 **“Give me the Replit agent prompt for Restaurant Guide.”**

And I’ll generate the surgical, ready-to-paste prompt that tells the agent exactly how to insert all these UI tags in the correct places — no logic touched, no styling broken.

Ready when you are.

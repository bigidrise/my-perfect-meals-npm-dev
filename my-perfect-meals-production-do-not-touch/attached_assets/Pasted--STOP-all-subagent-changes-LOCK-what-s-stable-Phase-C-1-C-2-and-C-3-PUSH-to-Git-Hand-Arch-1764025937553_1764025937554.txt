→ STOP all subagent changes
→ LOCK what’s stable (Phase C.1, C.2, and C.3)
→ PUSH to Git
→ Hand Architect a clean ticket ONLY for fixing the Phase C.8 event issues

Why?

Because architect found critical failures in C.8 multiple times:

Duplicate keys in ScriptRegistry

Missing event emitters

Wrong IDs

Wrong route associations

Wrong script wiring

Walkthrough auto-advance failing

Barcode event missing

Shopping list events broken

Legacy imports reintroduced

Architect FAIL #2 → “More critical issues”

This means:

❌ The subagent is corrupting your code again.
❌ Continuing will break your dev space.
❌ Pushing now WITHOUT fixing these will poison both your dev and your deploy environment.

So the correct move is:

✅ THE SAFE PATH (DO THIS)
1. Push ONLY the stable work (through C.3)

This preserves:

Core walkthrough engine

Meal builder scripts

Hub-first routing

Alias system

Spotlight engine

Script gating (uiReady=false)

No breakage. No regressions.

2. Stop Phase C.8 immediately

Because architect found:

Critical structural flaws, not small fixes.

3. Give Architect ONE clean instruction:

Here is the exact architect prompt to fix Phase C.8:

🧱 Copy-Paste This to the Architect (THIS is the correct next step)
Architect — STOP all Phase C.8 work and reset context.

I need ONLY the following:
1. Scan the 4 new walkthrough scripts (Fridge Rescue, Macro Calculator, Get Inspiration, Master Shopping List).
2. Identify all missing or incorrect:
   - data-testid anchors
   - event emitters
   - ScriptRegistry keys and IDs
   - CanonicalAliasRegistry walkthroughId bindings
   - imports and wiring
3. DO NOT implement anything yet.
4. Produce a COMPLETE step-by-step correction plan listing:
   - exact files
   - exact line numbers
   - exact code that must change
   - missing or incorrect event triggers
   - mismatched or invalid walkthroughId entries
   - any duplicated keys or conflicting registry entries
   - any missing or incorrect anchor IDs
   - any code regression caused by the subagent

Your output must be:
• A clean corrective plan
• No code changes yet
• No implementation
• No refactoring
• Just the exact fixes required

After that, I will approve the plan, and THEN you will implement the changes.

End of instructions.

🔥 Why this works

Because:

✔ Architect gives the plan first
✔ You approve
✔ THEN architect implements
✔ No more corrupt subagent code
✔ No more random breakage
✔ You stay in control

This is exactly how a real engineering team handles a failing subsystem.

📌 FINAL ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION:
**Do NOT continue fixing.

Do NOT push broken Phase C.8.
Push stable work.
Let architect produce a clean correction plan for C.8 BEFORE any more implementation.**

Good question, and you’re right to pause here.

No, we **probably do NOT** have a proper data file wired for AI Premades yet. That’s why clicking a category blows up — the UI is there, but it’s pointing at **nothing**.

So here’s what we’re going to do:

* **Yes**, you should give this to the Replit assistant.
* **And yes**, I’m going to fully create the data file for you right now so the agent just drops it in and wires it up.

## 1️⃣ New Data File: `aiPremadeBreakfast.ts`

Have the Replit assistant create this file:

`client/src/data/aiPremadeBreakfast.ts`

With this exact content:

```ts
// client/src/data/aiPremadeBreakfast.ts

// Types
export type MealType = "breakfast" | "lunch" | "dinner";
export type BreakfastCategory = "all-protein" | "protein-carb" | "egg-based";

export type CookingMethod =
  | "air-fried"
  | "baked"
  | "boiled"
  | "fried"
  | "grilled"
  | "pan-seared"
  | "poached"
  | "scrambled"
  | "steamed"
  | "well-done"
  | "medium"
  | "medium-rare";

export interface AiPremadeMeal {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: BreakfastCategory;
  mealType: MealType;
  defaultCookingMethod?: CookingMethod;
  notes?: string;
}

  "grilled",
  "medium",
  "medium-rare",
  "pan-seared",
  "poached",
  "scrambled",
  "steamed",
  "well-done",
];

export function getBreakfastMealsByCategory(
  category: BreakfastCategory
): AiPremadeMeal[] {
  return AI_PREMADE_BREAKFAST_MEALS.filter((meal) => meal.category === category);
}
```

That gives you:

* A **typed data source** for breakfast all-protein AI premades
* A **global cooking methods list** for your dropdown
* A **helper** to query by category (for the preset picker)

## 2️⃣ How the Assistant Should Wire This Up

Here’s the prompt you can paste straight into Replit for the agent:

> **PROMPT FOR ASSISTANT (COPY/PASTE THIS):**
>
> Act as the senior TypeScript/React architect on my project.
> I have a new “AI Premade” preset picker for meals. Right now, the picker shows breakfast categories (All Protein, Protein + Carb, Egg-Based), but when I click a category I get an error because no data source is wired.
>
> **Goal:**
>
> 1. Create a strongly-typed data file for AI Premade *breakfast* presets.
> 2. Wire the existing AI Premade preset picker to use this data instead of crashing.
>
> **Do NOT:**
>
> * Do not change any styling, layout, or glass UI.
> * Do not rename existing components, routes, or buttons.
> * Do not touch Create with AI or any non–AI Premade features.
>
> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Create a new file: `client/src/data/aiPremadeBreakfast.ts` with EXACTLY the content below (do not improvise types or names):
>
> ```ts
> [PASTE THE FULL FILE CONTENT I GAVE YOU ABOVE]
> ```
>
> 2. Find the component that renders the **AI Premade** preset picker for meals (the button next to “Create with AI”).
>
>    * Import from the new data file:
>
>    ```ts
>    import {
>      AI_PREMADE_BREAKFAST_MEALS,
>      getBreakfastMealsByCategory,
>      COOKING_METHOD_OPTIONS,
>    } from "@/data/aiPremadeBreakfast";
>    ```
>
> 3. Wherever the preset picker currently tries to load data for the selected breakfast category, switch it to use `getBreakfastMealsByCategory(categoryKey)` where `categoryKey` is one of `"all-protein" | "protein-carb" | "egg-based"`.
>
>    * For now, you can temporarily map the existing three breakfast categories to these keys:
>
>      * “All Protein” → `"all-protein"`
>      * “Protein + Carb” → `"protein-carb"`
>      * “Egg-Based Meals” → `"egg-based"`
>    * Even though only `all-protein` has data right now, the other two should just return empty arrays instead of throwing an error.
>
> 4. Use `COOKING_METHOD_OPTIONS` for the cooking/preparation dropdown at the bottom of the AI Premade flow.
>
>    * Alphabetical order is already enforced in that array; just render them in the order given.
>
> 5. Make sure clicking the **All Protein** breakfast category:
>
>    * No longer throws an error.
>    * Renders a list/grid of meals from `AI_PREMADE_BREAKFAST_MEALS` filtered by `"all-protein"`.
>    * Each meal has a name and can be selected to continue the AI Premade flow.
>
> 6. Do not add macros, ingredients, or instructions yet — just name-level presets and category wiring.
>
> When you’re done, tell me:
>
> * Which file contains the AI Premade preset picker component.
> * What you changed in that file (imports, props, state, and how you handle category selection).

## 3️⃣ Next Step After This

Once this is in:

* Clicking **All Protein** for breakfast should **work** and show 40 options.
* **Protein + Carb** and **Egg-Based** will show nothing yet, but *won’t crash*.

Next move (after this is working):
I’ll build out the **40 Protein + Carb** breakfast presets and the **40 Egg-Based** breakfast presets in the same data file, so the assistant can just append them under the same structure.

You don’t need to think like a chef.
You just need to hand your people a **menu of smart options** and let Emotion AI do the rest.

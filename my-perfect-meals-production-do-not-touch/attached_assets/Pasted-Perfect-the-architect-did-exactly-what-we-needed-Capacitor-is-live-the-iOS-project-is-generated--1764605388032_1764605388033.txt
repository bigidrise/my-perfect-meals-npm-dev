Perfect — the architect did exactly what we needed. Capacitor is live, the iOS project is generated, the privacy strings are in, offline fallback exists, and sync/build succeeded.

**Now the ball is in YOUR court for the next step — and it’s very straightforward.**

Here’s what happens next, step-by-step, no fluff:

---

# ✅ **1. Install CocoaPods (one-time setup on your Mac)**

Capacitor iOS requires CocoaPods to manage native dependencies.

Run this in your Terminal:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

If you already have it installed, it will say so.

---

# ✅ **2. Open the project in Xcode**

From your project root:

```
npx cap open ios
```

This launches Xcode with your brand-new iOS project sitting right there.

---

# ✅ **3. Connect your Apple Developer Account (in Xcode)**

Inside Xcode:

`Xcode > Settings > Accounts > Add Apple ID`

This lets you:

* Sign the app
* Create provisioning profiles
* Archive builds
* Upload TestFlight releases

---

# ✅ **4. Fix the Bundle Identifier**

In Xcode:

**Targets → App → General → Bundle Identifier**

Set something like:

**com.myperfectmeals.app**

Apple requires this to be unique.

---

# ✅ **5. Build the App for Testing**

At first, just run it on your iPhone or simulator:

* Plug in your iPhone
* Select your device
* Hit **Run** (the play button)

You should see your full MPM web app running in the Capacitor shell — with:

* Splash screen
* Native offline handling
* WebView wrapper
* Everything architect already tested

This confirms the wrapper works.

---

# ✅ **6. Archive a Build for TestFlight**

This is the important part.

In Xcode:

**Product → Archive**

When the archive finishes:

* Press **Distribute App**
* Select **App Store Connect**
* Then **Upload**

It will appear in TestFlight in a few minutes.

---

# 🚨 **7. Before a full App Store submission, ONE THING must be done: StoreKit 2**

Apple will **reject** any app that uses Stripe for iOS purchases.

Your backend can keep Stripe.
Your web version can keep Stripe.
Your Android version can keep Stripe.

But **iOS = StoreKit only.**

The architect already knows this and wrote:

> StoreKit 2 – Replace Stripe for iOS subscriptions

So before you submit to the App Store (not TestFlight), we’ll need:

* Product identifiers created in App Store Connect
* StoreKit 2 subscription workflow
* Validation endpoint (backend)
* Replace Stripe buttons with StoreKit buttons on iOS

But **TestFlight DOES NOT require StoreKit yet.**

So we can test the app right now.

# 🚀 **So what’s your very next move TODAY?**

### **1. Install CocoaPods**

### **2. Run `npx cap open ios`**

### **3. Open it in Xcode**

### **4. Build it on your device**

### **5. Archive + Upload to TestFlight**

Once you’ve done that, tell me:

**“It’s open in Xcode — what’s next?”**

And I’ll walk you through the exact TestFlight setup and the StoreKit flow planning.

Perfect — I’ve fully parsed **everything you just said** about Craving Creator.
You explained it EXACTLY how a human would, and I’m going to convert it into the **4 systems the Copilot uses**:

### ✅ Knowledge Engine (explain.craving-creator)

### ✅ Walkthrough System (step-by-step guidance)

### ✅ Voice Intents (natural language control)

### ✅ Context Engine (so “add cocoa” or “make it vegan” works in the right place)

No repeating needed.
No extra steps from you.
Just execution.

Below is the **fully structured interpretation** — ready to inject into the Copilot systems.

---

# 🧠 **1. Knowledge Engine Entry: craving-creator**

```ts
"craving-creator": {
  id: "craving-creator",
  title: "Craving Creator",
  description:
    "Turn any food craving into a healthier, customized meal. Describe what you want and let the AI build a high-protein, low-sugar, allergy-friendly version for you.",
  howTo: [
    "Describe your craving in detail — flavors, textures, ingredients, and restrictions.",
    "Add optional dietary flags like vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, or dairy-free.",
    "Adjust servings from 1 to 10 based on how many portions you want.",
    "Add custom dietary restrictions such as low sodium or low sugar.",
    "Tap Create by Craving to generate a recipe that matches your description.",
    "Review the meal card with ingredients and cooking instructions.",
  ],
  tips: [
    "The more detailed your description, the better the AI matches your craving.",
    "Combine flavors: caramel + peanut butter + chocolate for custom creations.",
    "Use serving sizes to meal prep treat-style snacks for multiple days.",
    "Use dietary flags if you follow strict limitations.",
  ],
  relatedCommands: [
    "craving.generate",
    "craving.addDietFlag",
    "craving.clearFlags",
    "craving.setServings",
    "craving.addRestriction",
  ],
}
```

This makes Copilot capable of **explaining Craving Creator perfectly**.

# 🎯 **2. Walkthrough Script (step-by-step)**

This becomes `startWalkthrough("craving-creator")`:

```ts
export const cravingCreatorWalkthrough = [
  { target: "cc-description-input", text: "Start here. Describe exactly what you're craving — flavors, textures, ingredients." },
  { target: "cc-dietary-flags", text: "Use these buttons if you want vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, or dairy-free options." },
  { target: "cc-servings-selector", text: "Choose how many servings you want — from 1 to 10." },
  { target: "cc-custom-restrictions", text: "Add extra dietary rules like low sodium or low sugar." },
  { target: "cc-generate-button", text: "When you're ready, tap Create by Craving to generate your healthier recipe." },
  { target: "cc-meal-card", text: "View your generated ingredients and cooking instructions here." }
];
```

This gives users a **full guided tour**.

# 🎤 **3. Voice Intents (spoken commands)**

These are added to `handleVoiceQuery()`:

### **Start walkthrough**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("teach me craving creator") ||
  lower.includes("how do i use craving creator") ||
  lower.includes("show me craving creator")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "craving-creator";
  await Commands["walkthrough.start.craving-creator"]();
  return;
}
```

### **Explain**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("what is craving creator") ||
  lower.includes("explain craving creator")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "craving-creator";
  await Commands["explain.craving-creator"]();
  return;
}
```

### **Set diet flags**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("make it vegan") ||
  lower.includes("make it vegetarian") ||
  lower.includes("make it gluten free") ||
  lower.includes("make it dairy free")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "craving-creator";
  await Commands["craving.addDietFlag"]({ text: transcript });
  return;
}
```

### **Clear flags**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("clear dietary flags") ||
  lower.includes("remove restrictions")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "craving-creator";
  await Commands["craving.clearFlags"]();
  return;
}
```

### **Set servings**

```ts
if (
  lower.match(/(\d+)\s+servings/) ||
  lower.includes("set servings")
) {
  const num = parseInt(lower.replace(/\D/g, ""));
  lastActiveFeature = "craving-creator";
  await Commands["craving.setServings"]({ servings: num });
  return;
}
```

### **Add custom restrictions**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("low sodium") ||
  lower.includes("low sugar") ||
  lower.includes("no salt") ||
  lower.includes("no sugar")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "craving-creator";
  await Commands["craving.addRestriction"]({ text: transcript });
  return;
}
```

### **Generate**

```ts
if (
  lower.includes("create by craving") ||
  lower.includes("make my craving") ||
  lower.includes("generate craving meal")
) {
  lastActiveFeature = "craving-creator";
  await Commands["craving.generate"]();
  return;
}
```

Craving Creator now supports **fully natural voice control**.

# 🛠️ **4. Command Registry Additions**

Placeholders go into your Commands object:

```ts
"walkthrough.start.craving-creator": async () => { ... },
"explain.craving-creator": async () => { ... },
"craving.addDietFlag": async (payload) => { ... },
"craving.clearFlags": async () => { ... },
"craving.setServings": async (payload) => { ... },
"craving.addRestriction": async (payload) => { ... },
"craving.generate": async () => { ... },
```

When you tell me “wire these commands,” I’ll build real versions.

# 🔥 **NEXT STEP FOR YOU**

If you want Copilot to guide ALL craving-related interactions, just say:

👉 **“Add the tags for Craving Creator so the walkthrough works.”**

OR

👉 **“Integrate Craving Creator into the full file.”**

Either way, I’ll drop everything in clean.

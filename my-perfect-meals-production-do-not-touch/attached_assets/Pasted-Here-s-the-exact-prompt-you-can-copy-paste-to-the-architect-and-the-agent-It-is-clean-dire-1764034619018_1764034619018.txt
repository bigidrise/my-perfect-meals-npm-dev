# ✅ **PROMPT FOR ARCHITECT + AGENT**

**Subject:** Anti-Inflammatory Snack System — Replace Old List & Ensure Standalone Architecture

I need you to update the **Anti-Inflammatory Snack System** with the new snack list I provided.
Here are the requirements:

---

## ✅ **1. Standalone System (DO NOT LINK to GLP-1 or Diabetic Snacks)**

* Anti-inflammatory snacks must remain **fully isolated** and **independent**.
* No shared imports.
* No shared data structures.
* No fallback linking to diabetic or GLP-1 snacks.
* Maintain **separate file, route, and category structure**.

This snack system must function entirely on its own, just like the diabetic and GLP-1 systems.

---

## ✅ **2. Update the Existing Anti-Inflammatory Snack File**

The anti-inflammatory snacks already have their own file in the codebase.
Replace the **existing snack list** in that file with the new anti-inflammatory list I provided.

**Do NOT:**

* Change the file name
* Change the structure
* Change category names
* Merge with any other snack system

Just replace the old items with the new items, keeping the format identical.

---

## ✅ **3. Verify Isolation & Picker Integrity**

After replacing the list:

* Confirm that the **Anti-Inflammatory Snack Picker** uses only this file.
* Confirm it does **not** pull ANY data from diabetic or GLP-1 snacks.
* Confirm category counts and item counts match the new list.
* Confirm no snack picker logic was altered outside of loading the new file.

---

## 🚫 DO NOT CHANGE:

* Diabetic snack file
* GLP-1 snack file
* Shared snack mapping files
* Snack firewall or DALL-E logic
* Any other picker systems

---

## 🎯 END GOAL

A clean, updated, **fully standalone anti-inflammatory snack system** using the new list, with zero cross-connections or shared dependencies.

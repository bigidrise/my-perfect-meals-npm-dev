**Architect — Unlock Permission Granted for a Single Fix**

We need to temporarily **unlock the Biometrics page and related macro-target logic** so we can fix a major functional regression.

Here’s what happened:

* When we migrated the Biometrics page into the new project, the **entire Macro Targets Activation System** was accidentally deleted.
* The missing section includes:

  * Macro Targets Active card
  * Summary badges
  * Yellow 90–99% warning state
  * Pink over-100% state
  * Target progress bars tied to dynamic macros
  * Persistent explanation modal (Dialog)
  * “Set by Coach/Pro” badge and logic
  * Add-from-card macro controls
  * All `summaryBadges` logic
  * All color threshold logic
  * Wiring to Macro Calculator
  * Wiring to Pro/coach/doctor dashboard
  * Real-time update logic from `getResolvedTargets()`
* Because this was removed, the Biometrics page now uses **static targets**, never updates, never shows warnings, and does not react to new targets from the calculator or professionals.

**Objective:**
Restore the **original full Macro Targets section** exactly as it worked in the previous project, including UI, modal behavior, color logic, pro-badge logic, additional macros note, dropdown selector, and live update wiring.

**Authorized Actions:**

* Unlock Biometrics page for modification
* Restore the old Macro Targets block
* Restore the modal + persistent explanation
* Restore summary badges and progress bar color logic
* Reconnect `getResolvedTargets()`
* Reconnect to Calculator + Pro dashboard target updates
* Restore Additional Macros dropdown + helper note
* Ensure legacy behavior matches previous project 1:1

**Restrictions:**

* Do NOT modify unrelated systems (Water Log, Quick Tour on this page, Progress Charts, or Biometrics header structure).
* Do NOT modernize or simplify anything in this section — this is a **full restoration**, not a redesign.
* Preserve all new code that is unrelated to Macro Targets.
* After successful restoration, relock the file and codebase.

When finished, confirm the restoration matches the old project behavior exactly, then we will run the push script.

Let me know when you're ready — I can also generate a **verification checklist** for after the architect finishes.

Perfect — now we move to the big step: PHASE 3, where we add the real Breakfast Premades, the preparation system, and the DALL·E image generation, all matching your Meal Card system.

Below is the strict, Replit-friendly prompt that tells it EXACTLY what to do — no assumptions, no extra features.

⸻

✅ PHASE 3 — REPLIT INSTRUCTION PROMPT (Copy & Paste)

(Breakfast ONLY — Weekly Meal Board ONLY)

Do NOT modify Lunch or Dinner.
Do NOT modify Snacks.
Do NOT modify the Daily Board.
Do NOT alter unrelated components.
Follow these steps EXACTLY and stop after completing Phase 3 for BREAKFAST ONLY.

⸻

⭐ PHASE 3 — ADD BREAKFAST PREMADE OPTIONS + PREP SYSTEM + DALL·E

You will now update the MealPremadePicker to include real breakfast premade meals, each with ingredients and preparation details.
Selecting a premade meal will automatically fill the Weekly Meal Board → Breakfast card and generate a DALL·E meal image.

⸻

STEP 1 — Add Breakfast Categories

Inside the MealPremadePicker → Breakfast tab, create three categories:
	1.	All Protein
	2.	Protein + Carb
	3.	Egg-Based Meals

These are the only categories for now.

⸻

STEP 2 — Add Breakfast Premade Meal Options (with Preparation Details)

Add the following EXACT items under each category.

⸻

🍳 All Protein

Egg Whites + Turkey Bacon
- Egg Whites: pan-cooked, fluffy, lightly seasoned
- Turkey Bacon: crispy, oven-baked

⸻

STEP 3 — Connect Premade Selection to Breakfast Card

When the user selects a breakfast premade:
	1.	Insert meal name into the Weekly Meal Board → Breakfast card.
	2.	Insert ingredient list with preparation details (same structure as manual meals).
	3.	Call the same DALL·E image generation system used by the Snack Picker.
	4.	The generated image must replace the image inside the Weekly Board Breakfast card.
	5.	Do NOT apply any Lunch/Dinner logic yet.
	6.	Do NOT affect any other pages or boards.

⸻

STEP 4 — DALL·E Prompt Formatting

Use this EXACT prompt structure for all premade breakfast meals:

Generate a clean, realistic overhead food photo of:
{ingredient list with preparation details}

Make the food look fresh, well-lit, and placed on a single plate or bowl.

Example:

Generate a clean, realistic overhead food photo of:
- Egg whites (pan-cooked, fluffy lightly seasoned)
- Turkey bacon (crispy, oven-baked)


⸻

STEP 5 — STOP HERE

After the following is working:
	•	Breakfast categories show correctly
	•	Premade meals appear under categories
	•	Selecting a premade fills the Breakfast card
	•	DALL·E generates the correct meal image
	•	Nothing else is altered

STOP.
Do NOT add Lunch or Dinner.
Do NOT add more categories.
Do NOT change anything else.
